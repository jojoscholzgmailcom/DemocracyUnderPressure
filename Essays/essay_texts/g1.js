	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	
	<p align="right"> Populism seems to become stronger 
	the more intellectuals criticize it (Taguieff 1995, 43). </p> <br/>

	With the election of Viktor Orbán as prime minister in Hungary in 2010 and Andrzej Duda as 
	president in Poland in 2015, as well as the large increase of seats by Jimmie Åkesson in Sweden 
	in 2022 and Caroline van der Plas in the Netherlands in 2023, it is safe to say that populism is 
	on the rise. On the European stage, two countries are often regarded as ruled by populists, 
	which often coincides with an anti-European stance. One of these countries, Poland, has even 
	attempted to weaponize history in a bid to portray Poland as nothing but a victim. In light of 
	this development and the broader context of the Polish constitutional crisis, which was give a 
	new impulse with monday's ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is important 
	to analyze how the ruling Law and Justice Party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość: PiS) weaponizes 
	history to further its own interests. As such, the research question of this essay has been 
	established as follows: <br/><br/>

	<center>
	How does the PiS history policy help explain its anti-European stance?
	</center> <br/><br/>

	In section I, a conceptual framework of populism will be presented, as well as a short overview 
	of the ruling party which for the purposes of this essay is considered populist. For the precise 
	populist dynamics regarding the PiS, see Stanley and Cześnik (2019), as well as Zabdyr-Jamróz 
	et al. (2021). In section II, the historical policy of the party will be analyzed. It shows that a 
	recurring theme in Polish interpretations of history is victimhood. This ranges from demanding 	
	reparations from Germany because of the damages inflicted in the Second World War, to 
	questioning official reports surrounding the 2010 Smolensk air disaster. All these events are 
	interpreted to transform a “pedagogy of shame,” which allegedly signifies an attack on Polish 
	values, to a “pedagogy of pride.” The latter will be interpreted by looking into the official Law 
	and Justice party manifesto from 2019 (PiS, 2019). To understand the Polish view on identity 
	and education, this will be contrasted with European integration policies in section III. 
	Although the member states have considerable autonomy regarding history, core values are 
	laid down by means of treaties. The essay concludes that the way in which history is governed, 
	is fundamentally incompatible with guidelines set out by the EU. As such, skepticism toward 
	supranational organizations is no incident created by individuals, but the product of a long 
	process. 

	<h3>Section I: Populism and PiS</h3>
	<h4>Section I.a: Populism</h4>

	Populism is a contested term. Oftentimes, the term is used to discredit political opponents, 
	which led Ralf Dahrendorf to argue that “des einen Populismus ist des anderen Demokratie, 
	und umgekehrt” (Dahrendorf 2003, 156). As such, one should always be skeptical when the 
	term is used by politicians or media. That being said, the term does hold academic value. An 
	often-cited definition of populism is by Cas Mudde:<br/><br/>

	<center>
	“an ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous 
	and antagonistic groups, ‘the pure people’ versus ‘the corrupt elite’, and which argues 
	that politics should be an expression of the volonté générale (general will) of the 
	people” (Mudde 2004, 543).
	</center><br/><br/>

	However, Mudde argues, populism is only a ‘thin-centered ideology’ (2004, 544), meaning it 
	can easily be fused with other - both thick and thin - ideologies. In the European context, 
	populism is most commonly associated with the far-right, but this needs not be so. In the case 
	of the ruling party of Poland, PiS, the carrying ideology is one of national conservatism. 
	Conservatism in Poland has a history going back to the fall of communism. Following the fall 
	of communism, thought collectives were founded that spread ideas from conservative thinkers 
	such as Leo Strauss (1959) and Eric Voegelin (2000). The first Pole to write on Voegelin, was 
	Ryszard Legutko (1985), a political philosopher in Krakow, who would later found Eastern 
	Europe’s first conservative think-tank with an anti-liberal view in 1992: the ‘Educational and 
	Scientific Society - The Center for Political Thought,’ also in Krakow. As a departure point, 
	national conservatism takes a principled opposition to liberalism (Varga and Buzogány 2000, 
	1097). It claims to defend the national state as the quintessential institution to protect traditions, 
	which, allegedly, are attacked by liberals (Blokker 2019). This anti-liberal voice is still loud 
	and manifests itself, inter alia, in a distrust towards the EU, as shall be discussed later. <br/><br/>
	
	The second - and main - part of Mudde’s definition emphasizes the distinction between ‘the 
	pure people’ and ‘the corrupt elite.’ Ernesto Laclau argued that ‘the people’ is essentially an 
	‘empty signifier,’ meaning that populists can decide on the shared identity and articulation of 
	the volonté général (Laclau 2005, 151). On the other hand is the ‘the corrupt elite,’ which 
	includes everyone “who hold high-ranking positions within politics, the economy and the 
	media, but excludes the populists themselves” (Gwiazda 2021, 582, emphasis added; see also 
	Mudde and Kaltwasser 2017). The elite will be discussed later, but first a brief introduction of 
	the populists - speaking on behalf of the people - is necessary.

	<h4>Section I.b: What is the PiS party?</h4>

	The PiS party was founded in 2001 by Jarosław and Lech Kaczyński. In their view, the 
	liberal-left wing of Solidarity, which helped bring down communism, “betrayed the idea of a 
	complete break with the communist regime” (Folvarčný and Kopeček 2020, 166). Although 
	initially supportive of Lech Wałęsa as president - Jarosław Kaczyński was even chief of office 
	- the twin brothers were quickly disappointed by a lack of decommunisation. In the 2001 Sejm 
	elections PiS received 9.5% of votes, but it rapidly grew and Lech Kaczyński was elected 
	president in 2005. However, Lech Kaczyński died in the 2010 Smolensk air disaster, creating 
	discord in Polish society. In fact, the PiS still rejects “the official inquest into the causes of the 
	Smolensk plane disaster and to this day seeks to prove that it was a murder of Polish leaders” 
	(Folvarčný and Kopeček 2020, 167). More on that will be discussed below. <br/><br/>
	
	Although Jarosław Kaczyński participated in the 2010 presidential elections, he was beaten by 
	Bronisław Komorowski and subsequently stepped back from major offices. However, he still 
	remains chairman of the party to this day. The PiS was represented by Andrzej Duda in the 
	2015 parliamentary elections, which he won. Duda has since been president of Poland. He 
	became most infamous for the escalation of what has been dubbed the “Polish constitutional 
	crisis.” Before the elections, the Civic Platform party (Platforma Obywatelska: PO) had 
	attempted to elect three new judges to the Constitutional Tribunal. This much was legal, but 
	PO also attempted to elect two judges set to retire after the elections. In response, Duda refused 
	to swear in any of the five judges and instead elected his own. Since then, the government and 
	the Constitutional Tribunal have been in a deadlock (Kelemen 2016).<br/><br/>

	Worried by these developments, the EU intervened in January 2016 with an Article 7 TEU 
	procedure. Under Article 7, certain rights can be suspended - including voting rights in the 
	European Council. In December 2017, the European Commission held that:<br/><br/>

	<center>
	“Over a period of two years, the Polish authorities have adopted more than 13 laws 
	affecting the entire structure of the justice system in Poland, impacting the 
	Constitutional Tribunal, Supreme Court, ordinary courts, National Council for the 
	Judiciary, prosecution service and National School of Judiciary. The common pattern 
	is that the executive and legislative branches have been systematically enabled to 
	politically interfere in the composition, powers, administration and functioning of the 
	judicial branch” (European Commission 2017).
	</center> <br/><br/>

	Since then, the crisis has not been resolved. Since October 2021, Poland has received a daily 
	fine of €100,000,000 (lowered to €500,000 in April 2023). On June 6th, 2023, the Court of 
	Justice of the European Union sided with the European Commission, which is supposed to 
	settle the issue but which does not “affect Poland’s obligation to make the daily penalty 
	payments due in respect of the past.” In response, “Sebastian Kaleta, a Polish deputy justice 
	minister, called the verdict a “farce,”” and “according to him “[a]lthough the EU does not have 
	the authority in the Treaties to assess the organization of the judiciary, the CJEU has found that 
	it can assess the Polish one” (Camut 2023). <br/><br/>
	
	<h3>Section II: The PiS party's historical policy</h3>
	<h4>Section II.a: What is the foundation of the PiS party’s historical policy?</h4>

	In this section, we investigate the basis behind the PiS party's historical policy. In other words, 
	we present the PiS party’s views on Polish history and how it should be interpreted. At its core, 
	the PiS party’s history policy is based on the idea that Poles were repeatedly treated as victims 
	throughout history. In particular, the PiS party narrative repeatedly stresses the tragedy of 
	Polish suffering at the hands of external invaders (Hackmann 2018). Indeed, the country of 
	Poland has been militarily conquered several times since the start of the eighteenth century 
	(Biskupski 2018). The Partition of Poland of 1795 ended the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian 
	commonwealth to be split between Russia, Prussia and Austria. As a result, the state of Poland 
	ceased to exist for over a century until the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles revived the 
	state at the end of the First World War. However, the rebirth of Poland was short-lived since 
	they were invaded simultaneously by the Germans and the Soviets just a few decades later 
	during the early stages of the Second World War. As such, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact 
	marked the second Partition of Poland in modern history. Poland’s Institute of National 
	Remembrance estimates that around six million Poles perished throughout the Second World 
	War (INR 2009). These losses at the hands of foreign powers constitute an important source of 
	outrage and victimhood among Poland’s political discourse. For example, the former prime 
	minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki once said in a press conference that “the impact of 
	such losses are still felt to this day. We lost the elite, outstanding engineers and scientists. And 
	the entire Polish economy could not develop normally.” (Tilles 2022). In addition, in 
	September 2022, the head of PiS Jarosław Kaczynski claimed war reparations from Germany 
	for its actions throughout the Second World War, amounting to $1.3 trillion. Kaczynski further 
	stated that “such compensation will be paid for decades, but it is bearable for the German 
	economy” (Tilles 2022). <br/><br/>

	In light of this troubled past, Poland’s diplomatic relations with Germany and Russia were 
	fragile to say the least. However, these relations were further exacerbated after the Smolensk 
	air disaster of April 2010. This event refers to the crash of Polish Air Force Flight 101 near the 
	city of Smolensk (Tilles 2022). As stated above, this deadly crash killed a significant portion 
	of Poland’s political elite, including the President of Poland Lech Kaczynski, as well as the 
	former president of Poland in exile Ryszard Kaczorowski, the chief of the Polish General Staff, 
	the president of the National Bank of Poland, Polish Government officials, 18 members of the 
	Polish Parliament, and other senior Polish military officers. Both Polish and Russian 
	investigations concluded that there were no technical issues with the aircraft and that the crash 
	was likely due to human error, failing to adopt the necessary safety precautions due to the 
	turbulent weather conditions. However, the PiS party came to a different conclusion which is 
	more aligned with their victimhood view of Polish history. Namely, the party claimed that the 
	crash was “decided at the highest levels of the Kremlin” (Tilles 2022). In particular, the PiS 
	began spreading various conspiracy theories, claiming that the Russians intentionally shot 
	down the plane and that the government of the time, primarily consisting of the Civic Platform 
	led by Donald Tusk, helped cover up the plot. When the PiS party regained power in 2015, 
	they launched their own investigation into the causes of the crash. The head of the PiS 
	investigation Antoni Macierewicz claimed that the investigation yielded definitive proof that 
	the crash was not an accident (Tilles 2022). To this day, the investigation has yet to provide 
	any evidence to overturn the conclusions reached by the former Polish and Russian 
	investigations. Families of the victims of the crash were granted access to the report. Barbara 
	Nowacka, an opposition member of parliament whose mother died in the crash, was given 
	access to the text, describing it as a “political report (…) that has very little to do with the real 
	evidence” (Tilles 2022). This highlights the fact that the PiS interpretation of Polish history has 
	a significant effect on their political discourse. <br/><br/>

	<h4>Section II.b: Pedagogy of shame.</h4>

	A recurring theme that is observed among the discourse of PiS party officials is to characterize 
	any narrative that does not conform to the aforementioned victimhood view of Polish history 
	as “pedagogy of shame.” This type of discourse is described by PiS officials as a bad-faith 
	perspective of Polish history that is marked by exaggerating negative Polish national 
	characteristics or highlighting dark episodes of Polish history (Kobylarek 2020). As a result, 
	this allows the PiS party to label any opposing view under the same umbrella term which stifles 
	the development of a nuanced debate regarding Polish history. <br/><br/>

	A critical example of "pedagogy of shame" is the Jedwabne pogrom. This refers to a massacre 
	of Polish Jews in the city of Jedwabne in the summer of 1941 (Hackmann 2018). In 2001, the 
	president Aleksander Kwaśniewski issued a national apology after acknowledging that ethnic 
	Poles were responsible for the killings. Ten years later, the apology was repeated by president 
	Bronisław Komorowski. The current President Andrzej Duda has openly criticized his 
	predecessors’ apologies since the current president views the event as "an attack on Polishness, 
	Polish values and Polish identity" (Michlic 2017). Shortly after coming to power, the party 
	called for a re-evaluation of the Jedwabne pogrom, citing a misjudgment of the importance of 
	the role of nazis and communists in the affair (Ambrosewicz-Jacobs and Szuchta 2014). The 
	education Minister Anna Zalewska stated that the event should be viewed in the context of 
	German occupation, despite acknowledging the fact that ethnic Poles were responsible for the 
	killings. <br/><br/>

	Another example that is commonly labeled as pedagogy of shame is President Barack Obama's 
	2012 speech in Warsaw where he used the term "Polish death camps" to denote the 
	concentration camps used to exterminate Jews during the Second World War (Komorowski 
	2012). In response, Jaroslaw Kaczynski stated, "We need to make it clear today (…) the end of 
	the pedagogy of shame, the end of this constant expiation of our nation, for whatever reason, 
	self-blame, because this is what makes it easier and even encourages us to do this kind of 
	activity, it causes terrible losses for us" (Majmurek 2016). Subsequently, regulations became 
	tighter under the PiS party. This culminated in 2018 in the banning of public speech attributing 
	responsibility for the Holocaust to Poland (Bucholc 2019). <br/><br/>

	<h4> Section II.c: Implementing a pedagogy of pride. </h4>

	In contrast, PiS party officials claim that any “pedagogy of shame” should be replaced with a 
	“pedagogy of pride”, a term used by various PiS Party officials including Jarosław Kaczynski 
	(Kazlauskaitė 2022) and education minister Przemysław Czarnek (Tilles 2021) placing an 
	overwhelming emphasis on the positive actions of Poles throughout history compared to the 
	dark episodes of Polish history (Ray and Kapralski 2019). When it comes to the Polish 
	historical curriculum, Czarnek claims that it is time for Poland to “finally end the pedagogy of 
	shame” and promote a “pedagogy of pride, as does every normal country in Europe and the 
	world” (Tilles 2021). While he does include that the curriculum should not forget about the 
	“ugly parts of Poland’s past”, he argues that an emphasis should be placed on “showing what 
	is beautiful in our history”. <br/><br/>
	
	To bring about this “pedagogy of pride” on a large scale, the PiS party has proposed a few 
	solutions which can be found in the official PiS party programme from 2019. In particular, we 
	focus on Chapter III.4 of the manifesto on the subject of education and Chapter IV.3 on the 
	notion of identity. To start, the PiS party aims to reform the Institute of National Remembrance 
	and use it as a tool in "shaping Polish identity" (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość 2019). The institute 
	dates back to the end of the Second World War. Its original purpose was to investigate and 
	prosecute nazi and communist crimes committed between 1917 and 1990. However, in 
	subsequent years, the Institute took on an academic role, documenting and disseminating 
	information about the aforementioned crimes (INR 2006). In recent times, some scholars have 
	criticized the Institute for being used as a political tool under PiS party rule (Ray and Kapralski 
	2019). These criticisms refer to the controversial 2018 amendment to the Act on the Institute 
	of National Remembrance, which penalizes public speech which attributes responsibility for 
	the Holocaust to Poland and of the Polish nation. The current president’s Andrzej Duda 
	defended his stance by stating that "carrying out the historical policy is one of the most 
	important activities of the president" (Duda 2015). Thus, protecting "the reputation of the 
	Republic of Poland and the Polish nation" at all costs can be seen as one of its core missions. <br/><br/>
	
	Furthermore, we claim that the PiS party aims to appoint museum directors whose views are 
	aligned with the party’s historical policy. To bring about a strong sense of Polish cultural 
	identity, the party mobilizes a network of around 30 museums to "spread the Polish point of 
	view" (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość 2019). In particular, some view the objective of these museums 
	as "pushing the narrative that the Poles have suffered just as much as the Jews during the 
	Holocaust" (Jaskułowski and Majewski 2022). To illustrate this, prior to the party's ascension 
	to power in 2015, the foyer of the Gdansk Second World War Museum included hundreds of 
	photographs of Jews that were murdered during the Holocaust. After PiS came to power, a 
	wall-sized photo of a Polish family that was killed for hiding Jews, along with information 
	regarding the proportion of the population killed in each country during the war were 
	subsequently displayed to stress the uniqueness of the Polish nation's suffering (Walker 2019). 
	The historian Paweł Machcewicz claims that the “main goal of these institutions is to introduce 
	the Polish and Central European perspective to the world's narrative and historical memory, 
	within which our experiences often take up little space and are not sufficiently known and 
	understood (...). And the best way to do this is to show the Polish experience in a historical 
	context, against the background of the experiences of other nations and of the entire European 
	continent and the world, because the Second World War was a global conflict. Such a view 
	does not pose a threat to “Polishness”; on the contrary, it allows a better understanding of the 
	specificity of Polish history’ (Machcewicz 2019). In addition, some authors have noted that 
	"since 2015, the Polish Museum landscape has turned into a battleground between politicians 
	and historians" (Etges et al. 2018). These scholars are referring to the party's attempts to dismiss 
	museum directors that did not share the party's historical perspective. For example, Dariucz 
	Stola, the former director of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews was pressured 
	by PiS officials to resign his position after winning in by popular vote (Bill 2020). Eventually, 
	the party succeeded by appointing Zygmunt Stepinski for the role in March 2020, a historian 
	whose views are aligned with the party's interpretation of history. This can be seen from the 
	fact that Stepinski was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta by 
	President Lech Kaczyński for "outstanding merits in activities for democratic changes in 
	Poland” (Kaczyński 2008). <br/><br/>

	Moreover, the manifesto also singles out the importance of the European Solidarity Center in 
	the city of Gdansk. Its aim is to circulate information about Gdansk shipyard strikes which they 
	claim is the "greatest phenomenon of Polish republicanism" (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość 2019). 
	The overthrow of communism in the western world is predominantly associated with the fall 
	of the Berlin Wall. However, the party is of the opinion that the significance of the Gdansk 
	agreements outweighs that of the fall of the Berlin Wall and that consequently institutions 
	should be created to "fight for the image of Polish Solidarity" (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość 2019). 
	For example, they are currently planning the establishment of another institution that is similar 
	to the European Solidarity Center in the city of Szczecin to commemorate the Szczecin 
	Agreements of 1980. <br/><br/>

	Lastly, the PiS party cites the downplaying of Polish history and literature as one of the main 
	problems afflicting the current Polish educational landscape (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość 2019). 
	To rectify this problem, PiS party proposes to implement a “patriotic education” component in 
	the Polish national curriculum. This is achieved through frequent school trips to the 
	aforementioned museums including the Warsaw Uprising Museum, the Second World War 
	Museum in Gdansk and the Cursed Soldiers Museum, all of which stress the victimization of 
	Poles throughout World War II (Kazlauskaitė 2022). They write that “students will be 
	acquainted with Poland's period of enslavement by communist regimes”. Moreover, they also 
	aim to instill "patriotic values" into students by using reading material that is appropriate and 
	consistent with the party's view of Polish history (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość 2019). Lastly, they 
	view "respect for national heroes'' as an important part of a student's education. However, the 
	virtue of the aforementioned goal depends on whom the party deems worthy of the title of 
	"national hero". To illustrate this last statement, the party displayed Romuald Rajs and Józef 
	Kuraś as "national heroes'' during a 2017 exhibition at the Gdansk Second World War Museum 
	(Tilles 2021) However, as commanders of underground partisan units, they committed crimes 
	against humanity, including the immolation of Jewish, Slovak and Belarusian civilians. In 
	essence, the overarching theme of the education reform has been described by critics as 
	"reducing education to the process of internalization of major national myths and transferring 
	a simplified vision of reality" (Zuk 2018). <br/><br/>

	<h3>The PiS Party Historical Policy and the European Union</h3>
	<h4>Section III.a: Legal autonomy of EU member states regarding the historical policy</h4>

	Poland has been a member country of the European Union (EU) since 2004. Thus, it is pertinent 
	to discuss to what extent does the PiS party’s historical policy outlined in section II agree with 
	guidelines provided by the EU. While the EU primarily focuses on issues regarding economic 
	integration, trade, and political cooperation, questions regarding historical narratives and 
	remembrance practices have naturally emerged within its framework (van Hecke 2003). 
	However, the EU does not possess a comprehensive set of guidelines or policies specifically 
	dedicated to historical representation (Littoz-Monnet 2012). Instead, historical representation 
	largely falls within the jurisdiction of member states' educational systems and cultural 
	institutions. Matters of historical narratives remain the responsibility of individual member 
	states, with the EU intervening only in cases requiring European-level action, as per the 
	principle of subsidiarity (van Hecke 2003). Consequently, member states retain considerable 
	autonomy in shaping their own historical narratives and remembrance practices. <br/><br/>
	
	Nevertheless, European integration efforts, such as the creation of the European Union itself, 
	have shaped historical narratives within the member states. The pursuit of a common European 
	identity has led to increased emphasis on transnational historical narratives that highlight 
	shared experiences, cultural heritage, and lessons drawn from the continent's past conflicts. 
	(Calligaro 2015). Efforts to promote historical dialogue and reconciliation, particularly among 
	countries with historically strained relationships, have been supported by EU initiatives 
	through the establishment of commemorative events and joint historical research projects 
	(Littoz-Monnet 2012). In particular, the “Active European Remembrance”, part of the “Europe 
	for Citizens Programme” from 2007 to 2013, aimed to preserve “the main sites and memorials 
	associated with the mass deportations, the former concentration camps and other large-scale 
	martyrdom and extermination sites” of Nazism and Stalinism “as well as the archives 
	documenting these events” (European Commision 2007). Additionally, this program aimed to 
	keep alive the memory of both the victims and those who participated in the saving of potential 
	victims (European Commision 2007). <br/><br/>

	However, this “Active European Remembrance” action received criticism for its focus on 
	imposing a “singular remembrance culture” (Prutsch 2013). This emphasizes the need for 
	member states to critically assess their own national history outside of National Socialism and 
	Stalinism (Prutsch 2013). Thus, in 2013, support policies promoting a critical “European 
	culture of remembering” were proposed (Prutsch 2013). In any case, the historical policies of 
	EU member states are expected to “approach Europe’s past on the foundation of European 
	core values, create an open sphere of discussion, address uncomfortable segments of national 
	histories, base judgements of the past exclusively on the examination of historical facts, 
	and acknowledge the potential risks in legislating for a specific view on or memory of the 
	past” (Prutsch 2013). The core values on which the member states should base their historical 
	policies are listed in article two of the Lisbon Treaty and developed in the EU Charter of 
	Fundamental Rights (European Union, 2012). <br/><br/>

	<h4>Section III.b: The compatibility of the PiS party’s historical policy with the EU’s expectations</h4>

	At first glance, the PiS party's historical policy seems to exhibit both converging and diverging 
	aspects in relation to the expectations of the European Union. On the one hand, Poland’s 
	commemorative institutions such as the Warsaw Uprising Museum and the European 
	Solidarity Centre in Gdansk strongly emphasize the remembrance of the victims of National 
	Socialism and Stalinism (Kazlauskaitė 2022). As such, one might conclude that the PiS party 
	is not afraid to address uncomfortable and dark periods of Poland’s history, however, the PiS 
	party’s victimhood narrative in tandem with the pedagogy of pride prevents the Polish nation 
	from addressing episodes where ethnic Poles were seen as perpetrators. For example, the PiS 
	party refuses to attribute full responsibility to the ethnic Poles that were responsible for the 
	Jedwabne pogrom, stating that the event should be interpreted in the context of German 
	occupation (Ambrosewicz-Jacobs and Szuchta 2014). In other words, the PiS party is only 
	willing to address dark episodes of Polish history as long as Poles are viewed in a position of 
	moral superiority (Ray and Kapralski 2019). The overwhelming emphasis on positive actions 
	of Poles along with the downplaying of dark episodes of Polish history raises concerns about 
	historical accuracy and objectivity brought by the historical policies of the PiS party. What is 
	more, this pedagogy of pride allows for the PiS party to group any opposing view under the 
	same label of pedagogy of shame which stifles the development of a nuanced debate regarding 
	Polish history (Ray and Kapralski 2019). Ultimately, the EU advocates for a balanced and 
	factual representation of history (Prutsch 2013) and the historical dogma implemented by the 
	PiS party that accentuates occurrences of Polish heroics and diminishes the uncomfortable 
	actions of ethnic Poles is in direct contradiction of those expectations. <br/><br/>

	Furthermore, the PiS party’s amendment to the Institute of National Remembrance, banning 
	public speech attributing responsibility for the Holocaust to Poland contradicts the freedom of 
	expression and information listed in article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental rights that 
	states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to 
	hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public 
	authority and regardless of frontiers” (European Union, 2012). By imposing restrictions on 
	discussions about Polish involvement in the Holocaust, the PiS party's policy not only hinders 
	the pursuit of truth but also undermines the EU's commitment to human rights and open 
	discussion. Moreover, in its early stages, the amendment to the Institute of National 
	Remembrance was heavily criticized by various scholars and journalists (Ray and Kapralski 
	2019) before being ratified by the Sejm in 2018. This shows a failure to consider potential risks 
	in legislating for a specific view on or memory of the past. <br/><br/>

	A study in 2019 that was conducted in all EU Member States except Sweden, Portugal, Spain, 
	UK, Ireland, Malta and Cyprus concluded that Holocaust revision is ongoing in Europe with 
	central European members Poland, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Croatia, and the Baltics bing the 
	worst offenders (Echikson 2019) The aforementioned study focused on how European 
	governments are minimizing their own guilt in the attempted extermination of Jews, which is 
	clearly on the agenda of the PiS party. In particular, its dismissal of museum directors and the 
	appointment of individuals who align with the party's perspective, raises concerns regarding 
	the politicization of cultural institutions. Such actions undermine the objectivity and academic 
	integrity of historical research and presentation. The PiS party’s historical policy and its efforts 
	to control historical representation to promote this specific, victimized version of Polish history 
	/ self-understanding restricts the diversity of narratives and impedes the development of a more 
	nuanced awareness which accurately describes Poles as both victims and perpetrators of 
	European history within the Polish context. <br/><br/>

	This is especially evident in the PiS party’s appointments of museum directors and newer 
	cultural institutions, previously mentioned in section II.c, which reinforce a narrative that not 
	only promotes the image of Polish victimhood but also downplays or omits certain historical 
	episodes that may complicate or challenge the preferred narrative. In doing so, the PiS party 
	facilitates an interpretation of Polish history that emphasizes the positive actions and 
	contributions of Poles while downplaying or disregarding instances that may reflect negatively 
	on the nation. By emphasizing the victimization of Poles throughout history, particularly during 
	World War II under Nazi Germany and the USSR, the PiS party fosters an already-present 
	sense of national identity rooted in resistance and resilience (Klajn 2018, Echikson 2019). This 
	narrative helps create a collective memory that positions Poland as a valiant defender of its 
	people and culture against external aggressors, reinforcing a sense of national pride and 
	solidarity (Klajn 2018). <br/><br/>
	
	Furthermore, Echikson describes Poland’s “historical understanding of itself as the ‘Jesus of 
	the Nations,’ a deeply religious country which has suffered for too long under the might of its 
	powerful neighbors” (Echikson, 2019). As the EU expects its members to encourage nuanced, 
	open, and factual discourse about their uncomfortable history, the discussion of Poland as 
	perpetrator and not only a victim of Nazism and Stalinism is necessary. However, this 
	discussion threatens many Poles’ understanding of their national identity (Echikson, 
	2019). Therefore, by promoting this victimized narrative, the PiS party strengthens its political 
	position by appealing to segments of the population that are skeptical of European integration 
	and to those who relate to Poland as the perpetual sufferer for Europe. The presentation of 
	Poland as a nation that has endured historical injustices and struggles against external forces 
	allows the PiS party to construct a narrative that fosters skepticism towards supranational 
	institutions like the EU, framing them as potential sources of infringement on Polish autonomy 
	and national identity. This selective approach to history serves the party's anti-European agenda 
	by encouraging a sense of national exceptionalism and self-sufficiency, reinforcing the notion 
	that Poland's interests and identity should take precedence over European integration and 
	cooperation. <br/><br/>

	Overall, the PiS party strategically employs a specific narrative of Polish history centered on 
	victimhood, resistance, and national identity to advance its anti-European agenda. By 
	constructing a collective memory that reinforces Polish exceptionalism, downplays negative 
	historical episodes, and portrays the supranational bodies as a potential threat, the party 
	strengthens its political support and increases skepticism towards European integration. 
	Through its control of cultural institutions and the circulation of a particular historical narrative, 
	the PiS party shapes public perception and influences the understanding of Polish history in a 
	manner that aligns with its anti-European objectives. <br/><br/>

	We attempt to explain the PiS Party’s anti-European stance by exploring to what extent the 
	history policy of the PiS party is incompatible with core European values. We argue that the 
	PiS party aims to portray Poland as a victim on the world stage, claiming that Poles have been 
	repeatedly mistreated by foreign powers throughout history. The PiS party claims that anything 
	that is not consistent with this view is regarded as pedagogy of shame. Instead, Poland’s history 
	should be viewed from a more positive perspective which is labelled as pedagogy of pride. 
	According to their 2019 manifesto, the PiS party aims to implement this pedagogy of pride 
	through various methods, including institutions such as the Institute of National Remembrance, 
	the Gdansk Solidarity Center and a network of museums including the Second World War 
	museum in Gdansk and the Warsaw Uprising museum. While EU member states are free to 
	determine their historical policy as they see fit, they should follow certain guidelines which are 
	consistent with the core values of the EU. Namely, member states should create an open sphere 
	of discussion, address uncomfortable segments of national histories, base judgements of the 
	past exclusively on the examination of historical facts, and acknowledge the potential risks in 
	legislating for a specific view on or memory of the past. We argue that the historical policy of 
	the PiS party violates every single guideline outlined above. These incompatibilities help 
	understand the motivation behind PiS party’s scepticism towards supranational institutions 
	such as the EU.`;
