	Analysing the PiS Party Narrative in Light of

	var text = `<h3>Introduction</h3>

	In the realm of political analysis, examining the influence of historical 
	philosophical ideas on contemporary political narratives can provide valuable insights 
	into the evolution of societies and their governance systems. In this comparative analysis, 
	the paper delves into Jean-Jacques Rousseau's considerations on Poland and the Party 
	Programme of the Polish Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS) Party in 2019. The aim of this 
	paper is to explore the extent to which the narrative of the PiS Party draws inspiration 
	from Rousseau's ideas.<br/><br/>

	To accomplish this task, a specific lens will be employed through which both 
	Rousseau's considerations and the PiS party Programme will be read and analysed. This 
	approach requires the two texts using one of the approaches to populism mentioned 
	below. By focusing on a particular lens, a comprehensive and coherent comparative 
	analysis is facilitated, enabling to identify similarities and assess the degree of influence 
	Rousseau's ideas may have had on the PiS Party's narrative.<br/><br/>

	The selected lens should be able to capture the essence of populism as it pertains 
	to the economic, educational, and military domains—the three specific areas scrutinised 
	in the analysis. By examining these key aspects of the PiS Party's Programme and 
	comparing them to Rousseau's thoughts on Poland, any parallels, potential ideological 
	alignments, or shared goals between the two are discerned.<br/><br/>

	By embarking on this comparative study, the paper seeks to answer the 
	fundamental question: To what extent can we argue that the Polish PiS Party narrative 
	is inspired by Rousseau's considerations? Through rigorous examination and 
	evaluation, this paper hopes to shed light on the potential intellectual and ideological 
	links between Rousseau's ideas and the political rhetoric of the PiS Party.<br/><br/>

	In the subsequent sections of the analysis, the paper will delve into the economic, 
	educational, and military aspects of both Rousseau's considerations on Poland and the 
	PiS Party Programme. By exploring these specific areas, the paper aims to provide a 
	comprehensive understanding of the shared narratives and potential influences at play. <br/><br/>

	Ultimately, the comparative analysis aims to contribute to a deeper 
	comprehension of the contemporary Polish political landscape by tracing the echoes of 
	Rousseau's philosophical insights and examining their implications for the PiS Party's 
	narrative. <br/><br/>
	
	<h3>Prawo i Sprawiedliwość: Historical Background</h3>

	The Prawo i Sprawiedliwość party (PiS, English: Law and Justice) was formed in 
	2001 by the twins Jarosław and Lech Kaczyński. The party had split from the Solidarity 
	Electoral Action and turned the Porozumienie Centrum party (PC, English: Centre 
	Agreement), that had been chaired by Jarosław himself, into PiS. Its first major success 
	was in 2005 when PiS won the parliamentary and presidential elections, after which Lech 
	became the president of Poland. The win can be explained through multiple reasons, such 
	as the previous government (Democratic Left Alliance) being plagued by corruption 
	scandals, as well as populist appeal, nationalist sentiment, catholic values and strong 
	leadership by Jarosław Kaczynski (Kowalczyk 2016). In the 2007 elections, PiS placed 
	second and remained in the parliamentary opposition until 2015 (Britannica). In 2010, 
	Lech Kaczyński died in an aeroplane crash, which made his twin brother Jarosław the 
	sole leader of the party. In the 2015 parliamentary elections, PiS won with an outright 
	majority, something no Polish party had done since the fall of communism (BBC 2015). 
	The reasons were similar to the 2005 election, as the government (Civic Platform) that 
	had been in power since 2007 had once again been affected by corruption scandals. 
	Additionally, Europe was dealing with a large influx of immigrants, to which PiS 
	promised to protect Poland from the perceived threat of the incoming Muslim population 
	(Kulesza & Rae 2017).<br/><br/>

	Though many argue that the following democratic consolidation was linked to 
	PiS' rise to power, the faith in democratic norms and values of both citizens and elites 
	was weak before the 2015 return to power of Kaczyński (Guasti and Bustikova 2018). 
	According to Eurobarometer, trust in government declined steadily and reached as low 
	as 14% in 2013 in Poland (Eurobarometer 2019). That year specifically had a sharp 
	decline in government trust due to a wiretapping scandal between government officials 
	and business people (Sobczyk 2013), as well as concerns on the handling of the economy 
	(Briebel 2013). There was an extreme polarisation between left-liberal and conservative-rights 
	parties, which not only led to a general distrust of society towards these public 
	institutions, but also to a “mutual enemy construction” of parties on both sides of the 
	ideological spectrum (Sata & Karolewski, 210). <br/><br/>

	PiS opposes liberal democracy (Tworzecki 2019), supporting controversial 
	reforms by the Fidesz party in Hungary led by Victor Orbán, and has shifted towards a 
	regime “rooted in executive aggrandisement, populism and nativism” (Bill & Stanley 
	2020, 378). Illiberal or defective democracies are based on a few factors. <br/><br/>

	The first one is that illiberal democracies often have a weak and politicised justice 
	system, which is also done by eliminating any kind of checks and balances. This is often 
	done by reforming the justice system in a way that either removes most of the power of 
	judicial bodies, or that replaces most judges, giving the ruling party a chance to replace 
	the judges at their own interest. In Poland, this was a big issue, when the PiS party started 
	signing new laws and amending old ones to fit their ideologies. In 2020, for example, 
	President Andrzej Duda signed a new law that promised “punishment for any judge who 
	dares to criticise the government's changes to the judiciary” (NPR 2020). Earlier in 2017, 
	PiS also introduced a law that lowered the retirement age, making it possible for new, 
	PiS-supporting judges to enter the Supreme Court (ibid). <br/><br/>

	Another feature of illiberal democracies is limiting the freedom of the press and 
	media. In Poland, PiS passed a media law in 2016 which allowed the government to 
	appoint the heads of public broadcasters and to dismiss them without giving a reason. 
	This led to concerns about the politicisation of the media and freedom of speech. 
	Additionally, in 2020, a new advertising tax was introduced, which many saw as an 
	attempt to financially weaken critical media outlets (DW 2020). While there is no specific 
	media that had to close down because of this, the impact was felt by many, for example, 
	the news outlet Gazeta Wyborcza, which is known for its critical reporting on the 
	government. The newspaper reported a loss of over 9 million złoty (approximately $2.4 
	million) in the first quarter of 2020, which it attributed in part to the new advertising tax. 
	In response to the financial difficulties, the newspaper announced layoffs and reduced 
	salaries for some employees (Applebaum 2020). <br/><br/>

	PiS has also been accused of undermining the independence of other institutions, 
	such as the civil service, public media, and non-governmental organisations. The 
	government passed a law in 2016 that allowed it to appoint the heads of public 
	institutions, including cultural institutions, previously appointed by independent boards. 
	Furthermore, PiS has been critical of NGOs, accusing them of being controlled by foreign 
	interests and undermining national interests (Gazeta Wyborcza 2017).
	PiS's policies on immigration and refugees have also been criticised by some as 
	being discriminatory and intolerant. The party has been accused of using anti-Muslim 
	and anti-immigrant rhetoric, and of refusing to accept refugees under the EU quota 
	system. In 2018, the European Court of Justice ruled that Poland had violated EU law by 
	refusing to accept refugees (DW 2018). Following the ruling, the Polish government 
	became more vocal in its criticism of the EU, arguing that the EU was overstepping its 
	authority and threatening Poland's sovereignty. In 2019, the Polish government 
	introduced a series of controversial judicial reforms that were seen as undermining the 
	independence of the judiciary and violating EU law. The reforms led to a dispute between 
	Poland and the EU, with the EU taking legal action against Poland for violating EU law 
	and undermining the rule of law (DW 2019).<br/><br/>

	It is worth noting that PiS has also implemented policies that are popular with 
	some segments of Polish society, such as increasing social welfare benefits and 
	introducing measures to combat corruption. However, critics argue that these policies 
	are being used to gain support while undermining democratic institutions and values 
	(Reuters 2019). <br/><br/>

	<h3>The Conceptual Approaches to Populism: A Short Introduction</h3>

	Populism is a highly contested concept (He et al. 2021, 3007) and the literature 
	on it remains largely underdeveloped, so that a unified conceptualisation remains wishful 
	thinking (Vittori 2017, 45). Each conceptualisation of populism is characterised 
	differently depending on the background of the scholar and their ontological premises. 
	He at al. (2021) have purposefully identified various approaches to populism which this 
	section outlines in order to give the reader a broader understanding of the political 
	processes taking place in Poland under the PiS party. The different approaches that will 
	be outlined in this paper's conceptualisation of populism are the following six: ideational 
	(Mudde and Kaltwasser, 2017; Shils, 1956; Mudde, 2004; MacRae, 1969; Moffitt, 2016), 
	political-strategic (Barr, 2018; Luther, 2011; Weyland, 2017), sociocultural (Ostiguy, 
	2017; Brubaker, 2017), discursive (Hawkins, 2009; Pauwels, 2011; Laclau, 2005), 
	political style (Moffitt, 2016; Abromeit, 2017), and social movement (Laclau, 2005; 
	Aslanidis, 2017; Williams, 2013). The first five approaches vastly correspond with the 
	course discussions. Yet, the last one is a new addition to the course work. As these six 
	approaches diverge from each other, the identification of a missing unified 
	conceptualisation is corroborated. Thus, a more convoluted model needs to be created to 
	find a conceptualisation that brings all the different approaches together. However, 
	finding this unified conceptualisation is not the aim of the paper due to its limited scope. 
	Thus, the six different approaches will be briefly presented to conclude that the first 
	approach of populism as an ideology represents the actions of the PiS party and the 
	nature of Rousseau's paper adequately. This helps the reader understand the rationale 
	behind the PiS party history and Rousseau's Considerations for Poland. <br/><br/>

	In this first and most crucial approach to populism for the purposes of this paper, 
	Mudde and Kaltwasser (2017) argue that populism should be defined as an ideology or 
	worldview in its normative sense. This ideational approach can be traced back to the work 
	of Shils (1956) who argues that populism comes to be in all countries whose people feel 
	some sort of resentment towards the leading regime that has acquired monopoly of 
	power and with that monopoly over the country's property and inherent culture (Shils 
	1956, 100-101). Essentially, there is a strong social gap between the ruling almighty elite 
	and the poor obedient common people. This leads to the understanding that the elite-dominated 
	institutions are power driven and betray the common people as they do not 
	represent the actual will of the vast majority of the people - the common people (Mudde 
	2004, 543). Yet, when looking at the ideological spectrum of “thick” and “thin” ideologies, 
	it is liberalism, socialism, and nationalism that are described as “thick” ideologies 
	(Mudde 2004, 544). Meanwhile, populism is considered a “thin” ideology because there 
	continues to be substantial debate over the conceptualisation of populism and it does not 
	show its own political Programme and thus needs to rely on other more sizable political 
	ideologies (Schroeder, 2020). Hence, Mudde and Kaltwasser (2017) derive that the 
	combination of populism as a “thin” ideology with “thick” ideologies is of rather common 
	occurrence. Despite the advantages of populism as an ideology which renders it rather 
	comprehensible (Mudde and Kaltwasser, 2017), there are some downfalls in establishing 
	populism as a “thin” ideology. MacRae (1969) for instance argues that ideology itself is a 
	contested concept. Thus, basing a contested concept such as populism on the contested 
	concept ideology increases the likelihood of greatly misunderstanding populism and 
	creating confusion. Moffit (2016) supports MacRae's argumentation and says that 
	populism is such a “thin” ideology that it is in peril “to lose its conceptual validity and 
	usefulness” (Moffitt 2016, 19). Yet, this approach to populism provides the reader of this 
	paper with an understanding of the narrative under which the PiS party acts and the 
	nature in which Rousseau's Considerations for Poland are written. It also helps the 
	reader to discern the analysis of this paper as both texts, the PiS Party Programme and 
	Rousseau's Considerations for Poland, were interpreted in light of this approach. The 
	next five approaches are outlined briefly for the reader to recognise why the approach of 
	populism as an ideology is the most significant to the paper and to provide a broader 
	apprehension of populism and its contested nature. <br/><br/>

	The second approach considers populism as a political strategy and argues that 
	the charismatic leader exists to gather and mobilise a rather unorganised mass into their 
	followers by connecting to the mass in a “direct, unmediated, and non-institutionalised” 
	way (Barr, 2018; He et al., 2021; Weyland, 2017). This approach explains the role of the 
	charismatic leader and their party as well as how they use their power and lead the people 
	(Luther, 2011). <br/><br/>

	The third approach conceptualises populism as a sociocultural phenomenon, 
	where the shortcomings of the ideational and politico-strategic approach are addressed, 
	and the cultural and social aspects to populism are emphasised (Ostiguy 2017, 92). It, 
	thus, looks at the execution of politics by the populist leader and how this is done through 
	communication, rhetoric, body language and behaviour (Brubaker 2017, 366; He et al. 
	2021, 3008). Like the politico-strategic approach and unlike the ideational approach, the 
	sociocultural approach to populism aims to bring about an understanding of how the 
	leader operates rather than explaining the role the people play (Brubaker 2017). <br/><br/>

	The fourth approach looks at populism as a discourse differentiating between 
	“good with a unified will of the people” and “evil with a conspiring elite”, according to 
	Hawkins (2009, 1042). Thus, there is a clear demarcation between those populist leaders 
	that aim at bringing the people together and realise their will, and those populist leaders 
	that primarily want to fulfil their self-interest and that of their regime. In this approach, 
	the demarcation between good and evil is made clear through language and the analysis 
	of texts. This approach solely focuses on the language used and does not go beyond this. <br/><br/>

	In this fifth approach to populism Moffitt (2016) moves the focus from looking at 
	how discourse affects the people to understanding how these effects are formed and 
	distributed (He et al. 2021, 3009). It is about the symbols that populist leaders use in 
	their performances that make them get the political power to govern the common people. 
	Moffitt claims that by understanding populism as a political style, it fills the “thin” 
	ideology (Mudde and Kaltwasser, 2017) and gives it meaning. Yet, Abromeit (2017) and 
	Weyland (2001) criticise this approach for being too broad, lacking details, and not 
	looking into the social and historical context in which the performance is held. <br/><br/>

	Last but not least, Laclau (2005) looks beyond the institutional structures and 
	aims to understand populism as a social movement in which grassroots initiatives come 
	together (He et al. 2021, 3009). Along the same lines, Aslanidis (2017) made it his goal 
	to establish a balance of the study of political parties and the study of grassroots 
	initiatives to make the study of grassroots initiatives come more into the limelight. <br/><br/>

	As the above has shown, the research on populism and the approaches to 
	populism are all rather centred around a Western context which shapes the 
	understanding of populism. The six approaches all look at populism through a lens of the 
	populist charismatic leaders and the populist political parties - what they do and how 
	they attract the people in masses. However, this results in an understanding of populism 
	that is top-down (He et al. 2021, 3010) through the charismatic leaders that win elections 
	and make their movements visible, rather than bottom-up where the people would be the 
	centre of attention. Ultimately, the identification of a missing unified conceptualisation 
	in the beginning of this section is corroborated. Hence, a more convoluted model needs 
	to be created to find a conceptualisation that brings all the different approaches together. 
	In order to avoid convoluting this paper, the sources were read through the first 
	approach, i.e., populism as an ideology, and the paper was written in light of this 
	approach. This approach was chosen because elements of Rousseau's considerations and 
	the PiS Party Programme show an understanding of populism with the elite-dominated 
	institutions that are power driven and betray the common people as they do not represent
	the actual will of the common people. <br/><br/>

	<h3>Rousseau's Considerations for Poland Summarised</h3>
	<h4>Rousseau and Populism</h4>

	As this paper investigates Rousseau's text through the lens of populism, it is 
	relevant to discuss how Rousseau's ideas are related to modern-day populism.<br/><br/>

	There have been parallels drawn between modern day populism's emphasis on 
	the collective will of the people, and Rousseau's concept of the general will (Crick 2005). 
	While the theory supposedly rests on equality for every man and their opinions, the 
	theory has been problematised by many as the will of the majority may lead to 
	discrimination and injustice for smaller groups in society (Crick 2005). “Scholars have 
	long realised that Rousseau's populist theory of the General Will has been a necessary 
	condition for totalitarianism as well as for liberal democracy” (Crick 2005, 628). Even 
	so, the juxtaposition of the ordinary people versus the elite found in modern day 
	populism (Cozzaglio, 2020) can also be found in the works of Rousseau, most notably in 
	the Social Contract. However, Rousseau frequently addresses Polish people in his 
	Considerations for Poland, addressing them as a people and advocating equality to make 
	the Polish identity, and thus the nation, stronger. <br/><br/>

	Furthermore, Rousseau's ideas are used even in modern times by political parties 
	primarily described as populist, such as the Italian 5 Stars Movement (5SM) (Cozzaglio 
	2020). In 2016, the political party launched a Rousseau platform which allowed users to 
	“propose new laws, vote for candidates to form electoral lists and suggest how the 
	movement should position itself with regard to certain issues” (Cozzaglio 2020, 277). The 
	aim of the platform, which functions as a type of direct democracy, was to facilitate 
	making peoples' voices heard. It draws on Rousseau's idea of the general will and the 
	importance of every individual as unique and with a voice and adapts this idea into the 
	modern era of digitalisation as it aims to directly connect citizens and institutions 
	(Cozzaglio 2020). <br/><br/>

	In conclusion, the comparison and parallels between Rousseau and modern-day
	populism are supported by previous scholars' comparisons, and the fact that parties 
	described as populists draw inspiration from his ideas. <br/><br/>

	<h3>Rousseau's Considerations for Poland</h3>

	As this essay analyses Rousseau's Considerations for Poland, the following 
	section introduces the main points of the texts as well as its historical context and its 
	relation to populism.<br/><br/>
	The essay <i>Considerations on the Government of Poland</i> was written by Jean-Jaques Rousseau 
	and published in 1782. In 15 chapters, Rousseau discusses Poland in 
	relation to its history, its neighbours, and the political situation at the time. At the time 
	of publication, Poland was known as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and they 
	were threatened by invasion on several frontiers (Putterman 2010). <br/><br/>

	In his essay, Rousseau comments on the history of the government of Poland and 
	expresses his surprise at how the state has survived that long given its constitution. It is 
	described as an oppressed and depopulated country, highly unstable in terms of economy 
	and military organisation. However, while other European countries are “rushing to their 
	ruin” (ibid, 1) and may soon face extinction, Poland is not yet lost as it still shows a 
	willingness to ask for a government and for laws. Furthermore, as Poland's citizens have 
	not mingled with the rest of Europe, this has resulted in a people with more unique traits 
	compared to their European peers, which they should be proud of (Rousseau 1772). In 
	conclusion, one might say that he criticises the “elite” while praising the people and
	encourages them to draw on their uniqueness as Poles. <br/><br/>
	
	<h4>The Current Political Situation of Poland according to Rousseau</h4>
	
	When discussing the unstable political situation, Rousseau's solution is 
	patriotism. The Polish government needs to ensure that the Polish spirit reaches all its 
	citizens and infuses them with pride to the point where the Republic is manifested in 
	their hearts and is able to endure hardship (Rousseau 1772, 21). Strengthening patriotism 
	will strengthen the country and protect it against its oppressors. Furthermore, Rousseau 
	states that there are no Spaniards, Frenchmen, or Englishmen, but only Europeans. 
	Polish people, however, with their unique culture, language and traits, can - and should 
	- foster a spirit typical of them and take advantage of their uniqueness (Rousseau 1772, 
	5). <br/><br/>

	Concerning the current political state of the Polish nation, Rousseau argues that 
	there is a clear division of its citizens: the nobles, who are everything, the burghers, who 
	are nothing, and the peasants, who are less than nothing (Rousseau 1772, 12). This is, 
	according to Rousseau, a more accurate description rather than the more conventional 
	description of the equestrian order, the senate, and the king. Rousseau argues that the 
	nobles, the equestrian order, are everything because without the equestrian order there 
	can be no senate, as the senate consists of Polish noblemen (ibid, 12). <br/><br/>

	Concerning the size of the Polish state, Rousseau states that its small size works 
	to its advantage, as small states can prosper for the very reason that they are small 
	(Rousseau 1772, 11). The dietines, i.e,. the local assembly of Polish noblemen is and has 
	been an important factor in preserving the constitution of Poland and preventing 
	usurpation, since the executive power is frequently transferred through re-elections, 
	although it is important to limit their authority so that they are still subordinate to the 
	Republic (Rousseau 1772, 23). <br/><br/>

	Rousseau does, however, comment on the practice of liberum veto, a 
	parliamentary practice in the Sejm which meant that any member of the Sejm - the 
	legislature consisting of Polish noblemen - could force an immediate end to the current 
	session, preventing any legislation to be passed simply by shouting “I do not allow”. This 
	practice was rooted in the belief that all Polish noblemen were equal and therefore, their 
	decisions should be taken in total agreement on all parts. <br/><br/>

	Rousseau's critique of the liberum veto is based on his belief that humans are 
	inherently selfish and will abuse this power, to the point where it becomes dangerous. 
	Instead, the agreement between members of the Sejm should be in proportion to the 
	importance of the question at hand. For example, the liberum veto should only be applied 
	to serious matters such as fundamental laws, and for elections and other matters, a bare 
	majority should suffice in making a decision (Rousseau 1772, 26-28). <br/><br/>

	The legislative power of Poland is, in Rousseau's opinion, remarkable and 
	deserves consideration, as it has the complexity of being powerless since nothing obeys 
	it, but powerful through not being dominated and not recognising anything higher than 
	itself (Rousseau 1772, 14). <br/><br/>

	As for the executive power, Rousseau highlights the importance of a well-balanced distribution of this. 
	Placing the executive power in the hands of a few 
	individuals can only lead to abuse. Therefore, it is crucial that the executive power be 
	divided in the senate between councils or departments, governed by a minister, who is 
	regularly re-elected and would rotate with other departments. Good laws and a good 
	government are thus made through a well balanced and proportionate diet (Rousseau 
	1772, 15). <br/><br/>

	As a final point concerning politics, Rousseau suggests frequently elected diets, 
	and ensuring representatives are bound to follow the rules to avoid usurpation and 
	promote an executive power which is not abused (Rousseau 1772, 14). <br/><br/>

	Rousseau specifically writes about four parts of the state: economy, education, 
	military system and administration. The first three ones will be discussed in the paper's 
	analysis and compared to the PiS Party Programme 2019. On administration, Rousseau 
	believes that inequality can best be solved by rewarding good behaviour and serving the 
	country (Rousseau 1772, 35). Additionally, he encourages teaching the three codes 
	(criminal, constitutional, and civil law) in order to raise people to be honest and virtuous. 
	By raising people to become proud, strong and virtuous citizens, you create citizens who 
	will gladly serve their country, come together in serving the country and decrease the 
	differences between classes (Rousseau 1772, 30). Due to the constraints of this paper, the 
	inclusion of this particular part in the main analysis was omitted. <br/><br/>
	
	<h3>Analysis</h3>

	Before the aforementioned considerations by Rousseau and the PiS Party 
	Programme are compared, it is important to specify our sources. The PiS Party 
	Programme, originally titled “2019 Programme Prawa i Sprawiedliwości - POLSKI 
	MODEL PAŃSTWA DOBROBYTU“ (“2019 Law and Justice Programme - POLISH 
	MODEL OF PROSPERITY STATE”, translated by Google Translate 2023), is the most 
	recent party Programme by the PiS party. The entire Programme was translated through 
	Google Translate on August 26th, 2022. <br/><br/>

	<h4>Economy</h4>

	This part of the analysis compares Rousseau's recommendations on the economic 
	system (Chapter XI) and then compares it to the PiS Party Programme. In the analysis, 
	the similarities and differences through the lens of populism as an ideology are 
	investigated. <br/><br/>

	Rousseau's recommendations start off with a clear delimitation of what economic 
	system one chooses. He gives two possibilities, a good system of public finance and being 
	counted as one of the great powers of Europe - or being a nation that “has no fear or need 
	of anyone, but is self-sufficient and happy” (Rousseau 1772, 32). With this, Rousseau 
	assumes that in order for a nation to be happily sustainable, it does not need external 
	engagement. He specifies that by following these recommendations, “you will not be 
	much talked about in Europe [...] but you will live in true prosperity” (ibid). The PiS party 
	states a different approach. For Poland, EU funds are very important, and it is important 
	to stay in relation to the other European countries in order to increase the wealth (PiS 
	2019, 105). Similarly, the PiS wants Poland to match the Western levels of standards of 
	living (ibid, 91). <br/><br/>

	Rousseau moves on to saying that this economic system that will bring happiness 
	and prosperity is reached through the focus of agriculture, as well as arts and crafts that 
	are necessary for the economic development of the nation (Rousseau 1772, 32). He 
	believes that the entire nation will benefit from making every type of job more about 
	honour rather than wealth (ibid, 34). This is the case for jobs that create inequality of 
	rank but also for the agricultural sector, which should be encouraged “by making that 
	calling pleasant and honourable” (ibid). This is comparable to the PiS' Programme. The 
	section on 'Care for the rurals and agriculture' starts with a quote by St. John Paul II “... 
	After all, farmers are not only those who feed, but also those who are an element of 
	constancy and duration. It is therefore essential that they have the right to a dignified 
	life…” (PiS 2019, 141). This quote shows the importance that the PiS gives to the 
	agricultural sector, introducing Programme that will also support the rural population 
	from poverty. <br/><br/>

	Overall, it is visible that there is some overlap between the considerations by 
	Rousseau as well as the PiS Party Programme. Rousseau underlines the importance of 
	prosperity over wealth, arguing that no money is more important than wealth. The PiS 
	reflects these ideas by encouraging the population to invest the personal savings in the 
	development of the Polish national economy (PiS 2019, 105). Rousseau also believes that 
	there should not be a tax for citizens to pay for infrastructure like bridges (Rousseau 1772, 
	35), and while the PiS does not explicitly mention that this sort of public tax should be 
	abolished, they do talk about the ideas of changing the taxing system and decreasing the 
	maximum amount for the lower taxpaying bracket (PiS 2019, 111). <br/><br/>

	It has thus become visible that Rousseau's considerations are limited to his time 
	(1772), and that investment into science and digitalization (PiS 2019, 120) is not a priority 
	for him at this time. <br/><br/>

	<h4>Education</h4>

	While there are several differences between the Party Programme of the PiS party 
	and Rousseau's Considerations for Poland, both share some significant similarities, 
	particularly in their emphasis on education shaping a nation's identity and fostering 
	patriotism.<br/><br/>

	Rousseau's chapter on education (Rousseau 1772, 9-11) discusses the importance 
	of education in shaping a nation's identity and fostering patriotism. He argues that 
	education should teach love for one's country, and that this love is linked to a love of law 
	and liberty (Rousseau 1772, 9). The 'true' Pole should be knowledgeable about their 
	country's history and laws by the time they are 16, and all citizens should be taught the 
	same to create a collective identity with shared morals and ideas (Rousseau 1772, 9). 
	Furthermore, Rousseau emphasises the importance of physical exercise and public 
	games for children to learn competition and living under the eyes of fellow citizens 
	(Rousseau 1772, 10). Lastly, Rousseau's chapter on education also stresses the 
	importance of well-balanced educational institutions that teach respect for the law and 
	the proper treatment of the state (Rousseau 1772, 10). <br/><br/>

	Quite similarly, the PiS Party Programme from 2019 on the future of education 
	and sport describes the education system in Poland and recent reforms undertaken to 
	improve it. The reforms have led to an expansion in pre-school education, with almost 
	88% of children in kindergartens (PiS Party Programme 2019, 127). Children can be sent 
	to school at the age of 6, and the education system includes 8 years of primary school, 4 
	years of general secondary school, and 5 years of technical secondary school (PiS Party 
	Programme 2019, 127). The education system focuses on developing students' creativity, 
	critical thinking, and logical reasoning, as well as teaching subjects such as history, 
	physics, biology, chemistry, and foreign languages (PiS Party Programme 2019, 127-128). 
	Moreover, the government is increasing financing for education, supporting the 
	development of children and students, and strengthening the vocational education 
	system (PiS Party Programme 2019, 1227). Teachers' salaries have been increased, and 
	rules for financing education have been introduced (PiS Party Programme 2019, 128). 
	The government aims to rebuild the prestige of the education system and promote 
	patriotic education, including Polish history, traditions, and cultural heritage (PiS Party 
	Programme 2019, 132-133). The education system also focuses on shaping students' civic 
	attitudes, social norms, and responsibilities (PiS Party Programme 2019, 134). Lastly, the 
	Programme states that the government is allocating more money towards sports facilities 
	to improve young Poles' physical condition (PiS Party Programme 2019, 137). <br/><br/>

	To compare, both emphasise the importance of education in shaping a nation's 
	identity and promoting patriotism. Rousseau argues that education should disseminate 
	love for one's country, history, and laws, whereas the PiS Party Programme highlights 
	the importance of teaching Polish history, traditions, and cultural heritage. Additionally, 
	both highlight the need for a combination of intellectual skills, physical skills and social 
	norms. <br/><br/>

	A notable difference between the two is that Rousseau suggests a 'true' Pole to be 
	knowledgeable about their country's history and laws as soon as they turn 16, whereas 
	the PiS Party Programme outlines a detailed education system. On another note, 
	Rousseau places more emphasis on physical exercise and public games for children to 
	learn competition, whereas the PiS Party Programme focuses more on the development 
	of critical thinking, logical reasoning, and creativity. <br/><br/>

	Overall, both Rousseau and the PiS Party Programme recognise the crucial role 
	of education in shaping a nation's identity and fostering patriotism. Yet, they have 
	slightly different approaches to achieving this goal. While one might think that the PiS 
	party might have been inspired by Rousseau's considerations through the comparison 
	and the detected similarities, it is not enough to conclude that the PiS drew its ideas and 
	Party Programme from Rousseau's considerations. For this to be argued, more 
	convoluted models need to be established.<br/><br/>

	<h4>Military System</h4>

	When comparing the foreign politics section in the PiS Party Programme with 
	Rousseau's considerations for the military system in Poland, there are several differences 
	but some important shared similarities, most notably the importance of patriotism. <br/><br/>

	A prominent feature of the PiS Military and foreign politics section is the 
	emphasis on international relations and organisations such as NATO, the EU and the 
	UN. Working for a united Europe is something to strive for and keeping a positive 
	relationship with Central and Eastern European countries is important (PiS Party 
	Programme, 2019). However, while describing the EU as important for Poland, they 
	emphasise the recent instability and attribute it to violation of international law, Russia's 
	“aggressive” policy and the crisis within the EU (PiS Party Programme 2019, 171). 
	Drawing further on international collaboration, the PiS party prioritises the relationship 
	between the United States and Poland, such as the North Atlantic Alliance summit in 
	Warsaw in 2016. The collaboration between the two countries resulted in them becoming 
	important partners in ensuring the security and development in Europe. The PiS party 
	identifies Poland as a key actor in the security of the European continent (ibid, 179). 
	Furthermore, when ruling Poland between 2015 and 2019, PiS drew inspiration from 
	Poland's history, such as the 1050th anniversary of the baptism of Poland, the 100th 
	anniversary of independence, the 450th anniversary of the Union of Lublin, and the 30th 
	anniversary of the first partially free elections (PiS Party Programme 2019, 174).<br/><br/>

	Rousseau, on the other hand, puts less emphasis on international cooperation 
	and more emphasis on the power of defence. Drawing on the strategy of the Romans, he 
	argues that a strong defence is key to protect oneself from the natural superiority of the 
	stronger (Rousseau 1772, 37). Arguing that Poland will never have a strong offensive 
	power, this does not have to be a problem when drawing on Poland's unique 
	characteristics as a country and focusing on the development of a strong defence (ibid, 
	37).<br/><br/>

	However, despite PiS focusing largely on international collaboration, similarities 
	in their plans for defence may be observed. For example, PIS aims to put money into the 
	military to modernise and increase the army with at least 150,000 soldiers. They will 
	achieve this through the “become a soldier of the Republic” Programme (PiS Party 
	Programme 2019, 187). However, as the section is brief and refrains from going into 
	detail, it may be said that the expansion of the army and the defence is not as largely 
	emphasised by the PiS party as it is by Rousseau. <br/><br/>

	One point where a parallel can be drawn between the two texts is that of national 
	identity and patriotism as an important factor in the stance towards the military and 
	foreign policy. While the PiS party promotes international collaboration, above all in the 
	European region, they believe that Poland, described as “the heart of Europe'' (PiS Party 
	Programme 2019, 176), should come first, and the PiS party is not afraid to stand up to 
	the EU when Poland's interests are threatened or at stake, and their primary aim is to 
	preserve Poland's interest, for example by keeping the zloty as the national currency (PiS 
	Party Programme 2019, 174). <br/><br/>

	Rousseau argues that shoulders should be driven by duty and not profession. 
	Arguing that humans defend what is theirs better than what belongs to others, Rousseau 
	states that an ideal Polish army should consist only of Poles, driven by their duty to serve 
	their country (Rousseau 1772, 37-38). <br/><br/>

	To conclude the section about the military and defence, there are mainly 
	differences between the two texts. The PiS party strongly emphasises international 
	collaboration and the importance of a united Europe, while simultaneously highlighting 
	Poland's key role in this, as well as the priority of Poland and Poles. Rousseau, on the 
	other hand, focuses more on the power of a strong defence and recruiting Poles who 
	willingly join because they have been brought up to be proud Poles who want to defend 
	their country. There is a general lack of the “elite versus the people” discourse in these 
	particular sections, which mainly appear aimed at “the people”. However, the people are 
	still emphasised by both Rousseau as well as the PiS party. The main parallel which can 
	be drawn is that of nationalism and patriotism, as the PiS party positions the welfare of 
	Poland and Poles as the underlying reason for all their suggestions. Rousseau, on the 
	other hand, uses nationalism as a tool to raise future soldiers by choice. Given the fact 
	that the texts were written almost 250 years apart, the political landscapes inevitably 
	undergo many changes and politics which were relevant in the 1700s may not be relevant 
	or applicable today. <br/><br/>

	
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>

	To summarise, a thorough comparison of Rousseau's reflections on Poland and 
	the political agenda of the PiS Party in 2019 indicates a mixture of corresponding 
	elements and clear distinctions.<br/><br/>

	On the economic front, both Rousseau and the PiS emphasise the significance of 
	an economic framework that caters to Poland's needs, hinting at a coincidental similarity. 
	However, the evidence is too scarce to support a definitive claim that Rousseau's 
	philosophy significantly impacted the PiS Party's economic agenda. <br/><br/>

	Education is a sector where both Rousseau's and the PiS Party's perspectives 
	align, asserting the crucial role of education in forming national identity and nurturing 
	patriotic sentiments. Here, Rousseau's confidence in the reformative influence of 
	education mirrors the PiS Party's strategy of inculcating national values and pride via the 
	education system. This mutual focus on education as a tool for societal cohesion offers 
	an indication of Rousseau's potential impact on the educational strategies of the PiS 
	Party. <br/><br/>

	In relation to foreign policy and defence, patriotism is a common thread. 
	Rousseau and the PiS Party concur that national interests should guide international 
	decision-making. However, their views diverge when it comes to the military. Rousseau 
	is predominantly concerned with self-defence, while PiS appears more engaged with 
	Poland's active participation in international alliances, especially the EU. This 
	discrepancy likely arises from the different historical and geopolitical contexts they 
	inhabit. <br/><br/>

	However, it is crucial to recognize the constraints of this analysis. Conclusions 
	based solely on observed parallels or disparities might be misleading, as these similarities 
	could stem from incidental overlaps rather than deliberate influence. The lens of 
	populism as an ideology through which this analysis has been conducted might 
	inadvertently restrict Rousseau's reflections to a narrow viewpoint, thereby impeding a 
	broader comprehension of their potential applicability.<br/><br/>

	Additional studies could augment this research by employing sophisticated 
	methods like natural language processing (NLP) to better analyse textual nuances and 
	identify distinct linguistic patterns indicative of certain eras. Also, contrasting 
	Rousseau's ideas with a more liberal party's Programme could offer a nuanced 
	understanding of whether Rousseau's reflections are inherently compatible with the 
	Polish state or are specifically aligned with populist ideology. <br/><br/>

	It is worth acknowledging that past ideas can retain their relevance in 
	contemporary contexts, underscoring the persistent influence of certain philosophies in 
	moulding societal and political narratives. However, it must be emphasised that the 
	evidence is not robust enough to claim that the PiS party was inspired by Rousseau's 
	considerations. The lens of populism as an ideology may have biased the observations of 
	Rousseau's reflections, urging the writers of this paper to err on the side of caution when 
	making such inferences.
