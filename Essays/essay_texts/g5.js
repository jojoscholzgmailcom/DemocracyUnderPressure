	var title = `Is the PiS Party Employing a Populist Narrative
	about the EU?`;
	var text = `<h3>1 Introduction</h3>

	In 2015, the Law and Justice party in Poland, better known by it's acronym
	PiS (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość), gained power and formed a majority government.
	Subsequently they used their newfound power to enact justice reforms to curtail
	judicial independence. One of the first things they did was replacing appointed
	judges on the Constitutional Tribunal with their own nominees, whose task
	is constitutional review. The PiS party then introduced new laws that gave
	the ruling party (now PiS) more power to control the judicial system. But
	the replacement of appointed judges severely impacted the independence of this
	court, and therefore their ability to make impartial decisions (Jankauskas, 2023). <br/><br/>

	The PiS party's actions appeared to undermine the independence of the
	judiciary, which led to negative reactions from foreign organizations, among
	them the EU. The EU in particular saw their actions as a violation of one of the
	cornerstones of modern democracy, the principle of the separation of powers.
	The EU believed that the changes the PiS party made were threatening the
	integrity of the judiciary, which could lead to an abuse of power by the ruling
	party and government. This could potentially lead to an undermining of the rule
	of law in Poland. This all led to the EU giving a recommendation to the Polish
	government to fix the issues they created to reestablish judicial independence
	and therefore the checks on powers still work as intended (EU-Commission,
	2016). <br/><br/>

	These actions on both sides led to a strained and deteriorated relationship
	between the EU and the Polish government under the Pis party, which in November 
	2020 led the Polish justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro to say: "This is about
	institutional, political enslavement, a radical reduction of sovereignty."(Tilles,
	2020) about the rule of law requirement of the EU, which reflects the Polish
	government's official stance on the EU. Historically, Poland has been considered 
	a satellite of the USSR since the aftermath of the second world war until
	their communist government was toppled by way of peaceful protests from the
	Solidarność movement (Klimczuk & Klimczuk-Kochańska, 2016). Poland remained 
	a de jure sovereign country, but de facto was governed by the soviet
	regime. Ziobro may have been drawing on historical context with his quote in
	order to make an analogy to contemporary events at the time of saying it. In
	other words, he may have implicitly been using the historical context of Poland,
	without directly stating them, to make a comparison to current events, implying
	a connection between historical events and contemporary issues. <br/><br/>

	All of these events then lead us to the research question of this paper, whether
	the Pis party is using the horrors of the past communist government to project
	it to the European Union (EU) and therefore create a populist narrative to rally
	support. <br/><br/>

	To answer this question, this paper is going to give the necessary background
	of the history of Poland after the second world war and the history of the PiS
	party in section 2. In section 3 the narrative of the PiS party is going to
	be revealed using materials created by their party. Lastly, in section 4 the
	previously introduced narrative is going to be analyzed on the basis of populist
	ideology. <br/><br/>

	<h3>2</h3>
	<h4>2.1 History of Poland</h4>

	After the Second World War, the Soviet Union established a communist government 
	in Poland after the first parliamentary elections on the 19th of January
	1947. The elections were seemingly democratic, but it was blatantly obvious
	they weren't. Opposition and activists were arrested by the Volunteer Reserve
	Militia (ORMO), a Polish paramilitary organization of the communist police
	force, and the elections were surrounded and characterized by violence (Wrobel,
	1998). The Democratic Bloc (consisting of the Polish United Workers' Party
	(PZDR), and its allies) would lead the country, and later become the only legal
	political party, making it a satellite state of the Soviet Union. The communist
	regime in Poland was officially proclaimed in 1952 (Kemp-Welch, 2008). In 1956
	Poland would experience a brief period of political liberalization, known as the
	"Polish October", after the death of Stalin and subsequent political "thaw" in
	the Soviet Union. Protests from students and workers led to the replacement of
	the communist leader Władysław Gomułka with Edward Ochab, a more moderate leader. The reforms were short-lived however, as the government gained
	back its control over the country by the end of the year (Brodsky, 1980). In
	1970 Poland faced an economic crisis, leading to widespread social commotion.
	Demonstrations were most active in Gdańsk, where the government would react with violent oppression. In the end the government reacted to the protests
	by increasing wages and other economic concessions, but the underlying problems endured (Sachs & Lipton, 1990). 1980 was the year when the Solidarity
	movement emerged as a major political force in Poland, they demanded more
	political freedom and economic reforms. While the government first tried to
	suppress the Solidarity movement (The Solidarity movement has left a significant mark on present-day political parties in
	Poland. Its influence can be seen in party logos for example. Where they try to evoke
	nationalist feelings, or draw trust from it (Hunter Jr & Lozada, 2019))
	, they were met with massive protests and
	strikes, this forced them to negotiate. After years, this also introduced the end
	of the communist regime, when in 1989 the first semi-free elections were held,
	and a democratically formed government was formed (Paczkowski, 2015). During the rule of the communist government they cracked down on anti-communist
	organizations, as well as called out martial law in 1981 after which a lot of prominent 
	members of the Solidarity trade union were imprisoned, among them Lech
	Kaczyński the brother of the future founder of the Pis party (Press, 2014). The
	government was acting as a puppet for the USSR and for example, the calling
	of martial law was imposed by the USSR. The semi-free election was decided
	during round table talks between the government and opposing groups such as
	the trade union Solidarity, where an agreement for the semi-free elections was
	reached. In the following year, Poland underwent rapid economic and political
	reformation when a new constitution was adopted and free-market reforms were
	implemented. In 1999 Poland joined NATO, and in 2004 the EU. This would
	solidify their place among other democratic countries. Recent years however
	have seen a return to previous un-democratic policies. The PiS party has restricted 
	freedom of press, undermined the independence of the judiciary, and
	promoted antisemitism and xenophobia (Bošković, 2020; Cap, 2018; Chapman,
	2017; Krzemiński, 2019). <br/><br/>

	<h4>2.2 Party History</h4>

	The Polish Law and Justice party, often referred to by it's polish acronym PiS
	(Prawo i Sprawiedliwość), was founded in 2001 by the Kaczyński twins Lech
	and Jarosław (Bale et al., 2006). During Lech's tenure as Minister of Justice in
	the years 2000 and 2001, the Kaczyński twins capitalised on his popularity to
	propel their newfound conservative PiS party into existence. This also made it
	easier for the party to frame itself as an anti-corruption party (The Corruption 
	Perception Index shows that Poland has been on a downward trend of
	corruption perception in recent years, which was already visible in 2016, but has
	been exacerbated by the government's response to the corona pandemic (Transparency International,
	2022). Note that this trend started one year after the PiS party came back into power in 2015)
	, which has ever since been a prominent part of their policy platform. They first gained seats
	in the Sejm (The Sejm is the lower chamber in the Polish Parliament.)
	in the 2001 general election, attaining 9.5% of the votes. Lech
	was elected as the major of Warsaw in 2002, making him hand over the party's
	leadership to his brother Jarosław. The next general election would follow in
	2005, and the PiS party would get 27% of the votes, the party was expected
	to partake in a coalition government. This did not happen however, since the
	expected coalition parties had a falling-out for the 2005 presidential elections.
	To increase his brother's chances of becoming president, Jarosław handed over
	the function of prime minister to Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz (Marcinkiewicz was a relatively unknown politician at the time, and didn't 
	have a significant political profile. The appointment of prime minister provided him with a political "carte
	blanche" however, and he quickly gained popularity. Making him one of the most well-trusted
	politicians in Poland at the time(Przegląd, 2006). He also supports the Polish membership in
	the EU, like the PiS party.), who would lead
	the minority government. In the second round Lech became president, gaining
	54% of the votes. They would form a minority government between 2005 and
	2006 after a period of political instability in the country, but this proved to
	be unworkable after an alleged rift between Marcinkiewicz and Jarosław (BBC,
	2006). In 2006 they thus turned to two other parties (the nationalist League of
	Polish Families and the populist Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland). This
	coalition was headed by Jarosław. The nature of the other parties did however
	put a dent on PiS's reputation. Following accusations of corruption and other
	problems, PiS called for new elections. During the 2005-2007 period they implemented 
	a number of controversial policies, including the introduction of a flat
	tax rate and the establishment of a new special anti-corruption unit (Bobiñski,
	2007). PiS also began to clash with the EU over judicial independence and
	freedom of press. During the next elections in 2007 the party would lose their
	power to the Civic Platform Party (They would however get a higher percentage of the total votes compared to the previous
	elections. The Civic Platform Party only had more votes, thereby winning. It could thus be
	said that the PiS party gained popularity for these elections)
	. In the period after this they would be in
	opposition until 2015, remaining a significant opposition force. 
	They would continue pushing their conservative agenda during this time, opposing abortion and
	same-sex marriage, and advocating for a stronger role of the Catholic Church in
	public life (Folvarčnỳ & Kopeček, 2020; Gallo, 2020). One important event to
	point out is the death of Lech in the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash on the
	tenth of April in 2010 (Gieras et al., 2013). Due to his passing away, Jarosław
	became the sole leader of the party. In 2015 PiS would come back into power
	after a landslide victory, when the party formed a majority government under
	the leadership of Beata Szydło (instead of the expected Jarosław) (Goettig &
	Barteczko, 2015). Ever since, the party has been in power, using the time to
	enact justice and media reforms that restrict the independence of both branches
	and shape them to be more in line with their view (Jankauskas, 2023). During
	Szydło's time PiS has focused on promoting national culture and identity, increasing 
	social spending, and opposing immigration (PiS, 2015). In 2017 they
	also proposed judicial reforms, which were signed into law by president Duda (This sparked a lot of protests in Poland and around the world, in particular Europe. The
	judicial reforms were viewed as compromising the impartiality of the courts(Guardian, 2017),
	this also led president Donald Tusk of the European Council to warn Poland that it might
	be kicked out of the EU because of it's judicial reforms and the undermining of the rule of
	law. The EU began an infringement of article 7 of the "Treaty on European Union" after the
	reforms (EuropeanCommission, 2017)).
	In 2019 the party would win the parliamentary elections again, this time with
	an ever higher percentage of votes. It would however, lose the majority in the
	Senate (Markowski, 2020). Under its new and current Prime Minister Mateusz
	Morawiecki, PiS has continued to push its conservative agenda, emphasizing
	traditional family values and national sovereignty (PiS, 2021). Despite controversial 
	policies, PiS has remained popular, in particular among rural and older
	voters. This has partially been attributed to their effective campaign combining
	nationalism and welfarism (Adekoya, 2017). <br/><br/>

	<h3>3 Pis party narrative of the EU</h3>
	<h4>3.1 Before Majority Government</h4>

	In their conference materials from July 2015, PiS sees two likely futures of the
	EU, the first being the disintegration of the union due to factors like the Eurocrisis 
	(PiS, 2015), and the other option is a further centralization of the union
	which will transform it to a body closer to a unified state. The party backs the
	opinion that such a centralization of the EU is significantly worse than a disintegration 
	of the union, though they acknowledge that a complete disintegration of
	the union would be a bad outcome and they are more in favour of a loose union
	of states that support each other and help each protect their interest from other
	superpowers such as Russia. The reason why the centralization of the union is
	so bad is due to the fact that according to them this would lead to the end of
	the sovereignty of Poland. Furthermore, the centralization of the union would,
	according to the PiS party (PiS, 2015), strengthen the power of Germany over
	the union, as Germany is one of the main beneficiaries of the union and contrary
	to prior opinions the EU is not curtailing the power of Germany, but is indeed
	strengthening the power of Germany. <br/><br/>

	<h5>3.1.1 Immigration crisis</h5>

	Another point that they made at the conference is that the EU is facing increased
	migration pressure, which they classify as a destabilizing factor, a point which
	they picked up on later in the year during a speech in the Sejm. In this speech
	in September 2015 Jaroslaw Kaczyński, whose party was still in the opposition
	at the time, talked about the migration policy of the EU (Csehi & Zgut, 2021).
	He was calling these policies an external oppression on Poland and that these
	policies from the EU constitute an attack on the (polish) people's ability to
	decide their own fate.<br/><br/>

	He further backed up his opposition to the policies by indicating that the
	acceptance of migrants that the EU wants to facilitate, could undermine the
	security of its members (Krzyżanowski, 2018). According to him, the refugees
	are unwilling to follow the rules of the nation, which will then after a sufficient
	rise of their numbers will lead to them demanding that their rules should be
	followed and therefore lead to a subserves of polish identity.
	Jaroslaw Kaczyński continues his speech with his reason for the immigrant
	crisis, for which he blames especially Germany for attracting the economic migrants 
	and says that as they have caused the demand that they should be the
	ones to handle it and that Poland should not be dragged into the consequences of
	what another country did, as it is not Poland's problem (Krzyżanowski, 2018).
	He lastly claims that voting for taking the migrants in is in the interest of
	Germany, which he identifies as the dominant power of the EU, is against the
	interest of Poland as this will lead to a flood of immigrants with anti-polish
	views.<br/><br/>

	<h4>3.2 Majority Government (2015)</h4>
	<h5>3.2.1 2015 Parliament speech</h5>

	In the first session of the Sejm with the new government on the 18th of November in 2015, 
	Jaroslaw Kaczyński is holding a speech to defend the party program
	of the PiS party (Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2015). In this speech,
	he is saying that there is a political fight in Poland since the end of the communist 
	regime and that one of the main casualties of this conflict is the truth.
	This means, according to him, that there is no such thing as the truth, but
	only narratives which are used to manipulate the population (Bundeszentrale
	für politische Bildung, 2015). He further claims that the media is especially
	responsible for propagating these narratives. <br/><br/>

	Furthermore, he claims that there exist laws from previous regimes that
	prevent people from speaking the truth (Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung,
	2015), which is a problem which prevents people from speaking their mind,
	which in turn ties into another fundamental right, namely freedom of speech
	which is affected. He claims that in a lot of countries in Europe, this right to
	freedom of speech is severely restricted and that especially traditionally Christian 
	opinions are systematically targeted (Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung,
	2015). The speech continues that Poland is the exception in Europe regarding
	freedoms and that Poland needs to continue to defend these freedoms and that
	it would be wrong to believe that they need to adopt habits from the West in
	order to develop their country (Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2015). <br/><br/>

	<h5>3.2.2 Rule of Law conflict</h5>

	Beginning in 2015, Poland has seen a political conflict between the ruling party
	PiS and the judiciary, known as the Polish Rule of Law Conflict, or the Polish
	Constitutional Crisis. PiS has been accused of violating the rule of law, and
	undermining the independence of the judiciary, leading to growing concerns
	both within the country and internationally. It all started when PiS passed
	a law which gave the ruling government the ability to appoint judges in the
	Constitutional Tribunal (The Polish Constitutional Tribunal is the judicial body whose main task is to check
	whether statutory law is in compliance with the Polish Constitution (Florczak-Wator, 2020))
	. This was met with protests around the country and
	international critique, as many people saw this as a direct attack on the independence 
	of the judiciary. Since the passing of the law PiS has continued to
	pass other laws that are seen by many as a threat to the separation of powers
	in Poland and the rule of law. Two other events stand out, the 2017 Supreme
	Court Crisis, and the 2019 Polish Judicial Disciplinary Panel Law. Both were
	met with extensive critique and international pressure from the EU. The 2017
	Supreme Court Crisis started when the government passed a law that essentially 
	made the Minister of Justice have the power to force all judges from the
	Supreme Court to retire. It was quickly changed however (The new law set the age of mandatory retirement from 70 to 65, which still forced around
	40% of the judges to retire. In 2018 after international pressure, president Duda reversed the
	law and made it possible to previously retired judges to return(Santora, 2018))
	, as massive protests
	were once again present in and outside of the country (Sadurski, 2019). As
	discussed in the section "Party History", this eventually also lead to the infringement of Article 7. 
	The 2019 Polish Judicial Disciplinary Panel Law was
	voted into existence to allegedly gain more power over the judiciary, and with
	this law a new disciplinary body was established which has the power to penalize judges 
	for misconduct (Ziółkowski, 2020). This action was again seen
	by many as an undermining of the judiciary and separation of powers. Despite
	ongoing and previous critiques from the international community, the PiS party
	has continued to push other judicial reform laws. They argue that those are
	necessary to root out corruption and reform the judiciary which they argue is
	elitist. The Polish government has called the interference of the EU with Poland
	a threat to their sovereignty (Reuters, 2021). <br/><br/>

	<h5>3.2.3 2019 Election speech</h5>

	In 2019 Jaroslaw Kaczyński held a major policy speech, because of the upcoming
	elections in Poland (Kaczynski, 2019). In that speech, he is going over the
	major topics of the party going forward among these topics was liberty which
	he identified as a core pillar of society that was once restricted to a single class
	in society, but has changed to encompass the whole country. This importance
	of liberty is then picked up on when he talks about Europe, where he mentions
	that while Poland is European that they are distinct and unique in such that
	in Poland they treasure liberty. He claims that Poland is an island of liberty
	that needs to defend its freedom against the slogans and agendas that are used
	in other countries across Europe in order to deceive people and allow for the
	restriction and even elimination of liberty and freedom.<br/><br/>

	The speech continues with the form of government, where he says that an
	representative democracy is the best possible system for a country, he then goes
	further and says that the system that many recommend is a tribunal system
	in which the judiciary has too much power and therefore it can not be described 
	as a democracy any more, as such a system only benefits the select few
	rich(Kaczynski, 2019). <br/><br/>

	Furthermore, he emphasizes that during the restructuring of Poland to become 
	the democracy that it is today that part of the communist leaders began
	to corrupt some groups that emerged from the Solidarity Movement, which lead
	to a spread of corruption in the Polish system which was being sustained by a
	small group of people backed by foreign money (Kaczynski, 2019), as this system
	benefitted them. Though this backing also meant that they were dependent on
	the goodwill of these sources. <br/><br/>

	<h3>4</h3>
	<h4>4.1 Populism</h4>

	According to Stanley (2008), populism is a thin narrative, which means that it
	can not stand on its own as it does not encompass an answer to a broad enough
	set of political questions. This then means that such a thin ideology such as
	populism needs to be combined with a full ideology such as to be able to use
	it, which means that populism can be somewhat flexible in how exactly it is
	manifested depending on which ideology/ideologies it is paired with. <br/><br/>

	Though it is so flexible, Stanley (2008) identifies for main characteristics of
	populism which are the existence of two groups typically called "the people" and
	"the elite"; a conflicting relationship between these two groups; the existence
	of the idea of popular sovereignty; the positive characterization of "the people"
	and negative characterization of "the people". <br/><br/>

	In detail, the two groups are portrayed as a singular entity with common
	characteristics that are being shared by all members of the group (Stanley,
	2008), which means that for example "the elite" might get the negative characteristic 
	corrupt, which is then used to portray that all of the members by virtue
	of being in that group must therefore be corrupt. <br/><br/>

	It is important to note that the adversarial relationship between the two
	groups is portrayed as a hard divide between the two groups, such that you
	are either part of "the people" with the corresponding positive traits or you
	belong to "the elite" with no middle ground between them (Stanley, 2008).
	This further creates a dichotomy between the two groups and therefore supports
	the adversarial relationship between them. Another benefit of the dichotomy is
	that it ignores the complexity that would exist if the groups were portrayed as
	heterogeneous (Stanley, 2008). <br/><br/>

	Usually "the elite" is portrayed not only as a different group with conflicting
	goals compared to "the people", but is portrayed as an enemy of the people
	with completely opposite goals (Stanley, 2008). It can therefore be used as a
	scapegoat for why "the people" are not able to achieve their goals or why they
	are having problems at the moment. <br/><br/>

	Lastly, the idea of popular sovereignty means in essence that the people of
	a nation are sovereign and therefore the general will of "the people" is what
	matters the most and because of that all the power should rest with the people,
	which can be used as another point of conflict between "the elite" and the will
	of "the people" (Stanley, 2008). <br/><br/>

	<h4>4.2 The elite</h4>
	If we look at the narrative of the PiS party of the EU through the lens of
	populist ideology then we can examine whether the narrative they took is in
	essence populist or not. <br/><br/>

	For this, we are first going to look for the group called "the elite", which
	is being assigned negative traits and is therefore demonized. In the case of
	the PiS party "the elite" seems to be the EU and especially Germany, but also
	other parties in Poland which are according to the PiS party influenced by these
	external powers. <br/><br/>

	They are especially focusing on the threat of Germany before they came
	into power before 2015, as they are claiming that the EU is basically a tool for
	Germany to extend its power over other nations instead of a tool for cooperation.
	They furthermore claim that the immigrant crisis of 2015 is largely created by
	Germany and that the EUs decisions regarding the acceptance of immigrants
	is in fact an external oppression of Polish people and as they are claiming that
	the EU is a tool for Germany to influence other countries they are portraying
	this as a specific attempt of german-centric oppression. <br/><br/>

	Jarslow Kaczyński then further expands, in his first parliament speech after
	the majority government (Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2015), on the
	oppression of the EU by explaining that there is a narrative being spread that
	the Polish people have to conform to the Western values and abandon the Polish
	ones to prosper. <br/><br/>

	Lastly, in 2019 he connects the EU to internal forces by claiming that after
	the transition from a communist regime to a democratic regime, that some of
	the communists have infiltrated institutions throughout Poland and are in fact
	corrupt(Kaczynski, 2019). This claim is strengthened by the fact that there
	was a peaceful transition of power from the communist regime to the newly
	elected democratic regime and therefore there was no symbolic break between
	the two regimes. The corruption of the individuals is due to the fact that they
	act on behalf of external people for profit and are therefore not acting in the
	best interest of Poland and its citizens. This not only connects their political
	enemies to "the elite" group which they have constructed over the years but also
	connected "the elite" back to Polish history and especially the parallels to the
	time under communist rule, which is negatively connotated for Polish people.
	This parallel can be seen especially between the influence the USSR had on the
	communist regime in Poland and how according to the PiS party the current
	Polish institution are under similar external control and therefore are not acting
	in the best interest of Poles. Another parallel is the adoption of external values,
	where during the communist regime the values were mainly about communism,
	the thread nowadays comes from western values such as same-sex marriage. <br/><br/>

	<h4>4.3 The judiciary a tool of the elite</h4>
	PiS has long argued that an elite is running the country. A lot of their supposed 
	power they argue, comes from them having power over the judiciary. The
	judges, lawyers etc... can decide on laws, prosecute people, and do other things.
	The main arguments for new laws (mentioned in section 3.2.2, "Rule of Law
	Conflict") putting judiciary judges and employees into retirement is that they
	are part of the elite, the only thing the law would do is getting rid of the powerful 
	elite in the judiciary, replacing them with judges from 'the people'. The
	approach PiS has taken is more subtle than other historical approaches taken
	by other parties/countries. They use a complex approach consisting of pressure
	and promotion. As Professor Stanley Bill from the University of Cambridge describes, 
	PiS tries to put organizations that are seen as hostile into bad daylight.
	And they promote organizations that are seen as in line with the party's own
	views (Bill et al., 2022). This is thus a modified form of an approach of "elite
	replacement". The replacement of judges (i.e. judiciary), can be seen as one of
	the tools they use for simultaneous pressure on hostile judges, and promotion
	of friendly ones. The judiciary is in this sense one of the tools among others
	(changing content from museums for example (IrishTimes, 2023), but a very
	powerful and obvious one in that. <br/><br/>

	<h4>4.4 The people</h4>

	The other group required for a populist ideology are "the people" which are
	given positive traits. The identity of the people are in the case of the PiS party
	the common Polish people. They are described as devout Christians yearning
	to live free lives and being able to rule themselves instead of being dictated by
	others. <br/><br/>

	The PiS party especially draws attention to the liberty aspect of the values
	of "the people", by claiming that Poland is a bastion of freedom in Europe
	and declaring that this especially is an important right that is under threat in
	other countries in the EU. This focus on liberty as an important value of "the
	people" that "the elite" is trying to suppress can be related back to the history
	of Poland. This especially goes back to the time in which Poland was under
	communist rule in which the liberty of Poles was restricted as protests against
	the government decisions were often violently suppressed. <br/><br/>

	Another important thing according to the PiS party are the traditional
	Christian values, which they claim are under threat from "the elite" due to for
	example immigrants and corruption. The PiS party claims that immigrants are
	coming to Poland to then impose their own (non-christian) values on everyone
	and therefore are in fact attacking traditional Christian values. Furthermore,
	as the immigrants are mainly coming to Poland due to the immigration policy
	of the EU this means that the immigrants could be portrayed as a direct attack
	of "the elite" on "the people". <br/><br/>

	Lastly, there is the sovereignty of the Polish people, which is seen as an
	important value that is under threat from "the elite", therefore a closer look
	into what sovereignty entails will be given in the following section. <br/><br/>

	<h4>4.5 Sovereignty</h4>
	Although many scholars have proposed intricate definitions of what sovereignty
	means, we are going to use a more basic definition in this paper. Sovereignty
	is often seen as being one of the cornerstones of democracy, and central in the
	national state (opposed to regional state). We can say that sovereignty is the
	supreme authority over something, a state is sovereign if it can at least be partially 
	successful in getting their people to not take the law in their own hands,
	but defer to the state when it comes to conflicts (Biersteker, 2013). The state, in
	other words, must uphold a monopoly of violence. And it can thus also be said
	that a state must be (at least somewhat) successful in punishing people that
	use violence without authorization. The institution that has nobody above it, is
	the sovereign institution (Let's take a school as an example. A school can enforce rules 
	and has authority (partially) over their students, it can make decisions which will be enforced. 
	They cannot, however, overrule decisions taken by the court or the government. This means that 
	they answer to other institutions. There is an institution that is "above" all other institutions, 
	we call this the sovereign institution)
	. In modern-day nations, sovereignty is a bit different
	than before. With multi-nation institutions like the EU or NATO, it can be
	said that nations have handed over their sovereignty to these institutions. The
	governments of the nations part of these institutions have handed over some
	power to these institutions, thereby arguably handing over some sovereignty.
	Before we look at the normative arguments of sovereignty by PiS, we'll have
	a look at the person often seen as the founder of sociology Max Weber (Scaff,
	2011), and Jean Jacques Rousseau, whose often seen as the paradigmatic theorist 
	of democracy (Neuhouser, 2011). Weber states that all governments must
	uphold a monopoly of violence in the territory ruled by them, this means that
	the state must have the ability to enforce its laws and maintain order within its
	borders. Furthermore, he argues that the use of force must be limited to the
	state, and no other bodies or institutions can use it (Dusza, 1989). Rousseau
	argues that sovereignty must remain with the people, and authority in the law
	must derive in some manner from their decisions of them. He thus argues for
	'popular sovereignty' (Rousseau et al., 1920). The PiS party has argued that
	the primacy of EU law undermines Polish Sovereignty, leading Jarosław to say:
	"opposition's fight to overthrow the democratically elected government" about
	the EU (Reuters, 2021). They thus argue on the basis of sovereignty that the
	EU law shouldn't be enforced for particular issues they have. <br/><br/>

	This stance of the PiS party on the issue of popular sovereignty fits well with
	the criteria described by Stanley (2008) in his description of populism, which
	is namely that there is a strong emphasis on popular sovereignty. This then
	allows the PiS party to act in the interest of "the people" and through that
	legitimize their actions as they are only enacting the will of "the people". This
	issue of sovereignty is important to the Polish people due to similar reasons for
	why liberty is important to them, namely their history and how in the past
	Poland was not a sovereign state, but was controlled by outside forces like for
	example the USSR. This importance can be seen in the messaging of the PiS
	party as this concept can be found throughout their messaging in a variety of
	topics, such as the immigrant crisis or the rule of law crisis, in both of which
	the conflict is coined as an attack on the sovereignty of the Polish people. <br/><br/>

	<h3>5 Conclusion</h3>

	In the previous sections, we have looked at how the criteria by Stanley (2008)
	on what a populist ideology consists of. Using these criteria we have been able
	to identify the two distinct groups: On the one hand, "the elite" consisting of
	the EU and internal political actors acting on the EUs behalf, and on the other
	hand "the people" which are the Polish people. We further established that in
	the PiS narrative, the two groups are in an adversarial relationship with each
	other by pointing out that "the elite" is portrayed as oppressing "the people"
	and that "the elite" is trying to force the Polish people to abandon their values. <br/><br/>

	This description of the adversarial relationship then also leads into the next
	criteria for populism, which is the assigning of negative traits to "the elite" and
	positive traits to "the people". On the one hand, through an adversarial relation
	between the groups "the elite" is portrayed as a tyrant that rules without regard
	for "the people", and they are also portrayed as corrupt. On the other hand
	"the people" are seen as a group that strives for liberty and has sound morals as
	they are following traditional Christian teachings and are portraying Christian
	values. <br/><br/>

	The last criterion for populism is the strong emphasis on popular sovereignty,
	which as we established above is an important part of the message of the PiS
	party. This means that the ideology of the PiS party can, according to the
	definition given by Stanley, be classified as populist and therefore we have shown
	that their narrative can be described as populist. <br/><br/>
	
	This means that we can answer the question posed in the introduction,
	namely: "Is the PiS party using the horrors of the past communist government
	to project it to the European Union (EU) and therefore create a populist narrative 
	to rally support?", as we have established that they are using a populist
	narrative and are portraying the EU to be part of the elite in that narrative
	as well as creating parallelisms to Poland's history, we can therefore affirm the
	main part of the question. The last part about rallying support is hard to
	evaluate though, because of the fact that it is relatively hard to evaluate the
	motives behind some actions. It seems likely that this narrative was used in or
	der to gather support as they were using this narrative in for example election
	campaign speeches, where they are trying to gather support.`;
