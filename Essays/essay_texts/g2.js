	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	In recent years, the European Union has imposed financial punishment on Poland for the changes
	made by the Law and Justice party to the judiciary power in Poland. On the 5th of June, the
	European Court of Justice even ruled those reforms to be in opposition to the laws of the EU because
	those reforms weakened the aforementioned judiciary power (NOS, 2023). In this context, it may
	especially be interesting to investigate how the Law and Justice party uses museums to their
	advantage.<br/><br/>

	Museums have traditionally been repositories of history, creating space for education, reflection and
	the preservation of cultural heritage. Under the governance of the Law and Justice party, a more
	patriotic point of view is taken and there is a clear distinction between the narrative of museums in
	Poland since the Law and Justice party rose to power in 2015. This is accompanied by growing
	concerns over the entanglement of politics and museums. The museum is now more aimed at
	nurturing a sense of national pride and as a remembrance of the brave individuals who fought the
	Nazi occupants during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. This latter purpose is now being torn with, as
	the party seeks to reinforce a particular interpretation of the historical context that aligns with their
	political ideology. By stressing the suffering of the Poles in a historical context the party aims to
	increase its support with populistic methods.<br/><br/>

	The remainder of this article will be organized as follows: first, background information on the Law
	and Justice party will be provided, after which some attention will be given to the current debate
	between Poland and the European Union. After that, there will be a section that defines the concepts
	of populism and nationalism. Then, there will be a section on the Warsaw Uprising, in which a quick
	historical overview of the Warsaw Uprising is provided. In succession, the history of the Warsaw
	Uprising Museum itself will be shortly discussed, and attention will be given to the documents and
	the initiation of the museum. This will be followed by a section that discusses the narrative that the
	Warsaw Uprising Museum conveys. After that, the literature on the museum and the politics of
	memory in Poland will be mentioned, followed by our conclusion. <br/><br/>

	<h3>Law and Justice party</h3>

	The Law and Justice (PiS) party was founded by Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski in 2001. It has been
	in power since 2015. With 237 out of 460 seats in the Sejm and 66 out of 100 in the Senate, it
	currently is the biggest party in Poland. The party is Christian democratic with a
	national-conservative political view (European Conservatives and Reformists, 2022). The party has
	been accused of promoting a nationalist and revisionist view of history that seeks to downplay
	Poland's role in the Holocaust and focus on Polish suffering during World War II.<br/><br/>

	Poland has a complicated history with regard to the Holocaust: during the occupation by the Third
	Reich, the Polish did not come to a collaborationist government while many other countries had. It
	was subject to direct and brutal control by the Germans. 2.5 million (non-Jewish) were killed and
	more than 1.5 million civilians and soldiers were deported (Shepp, 2018). Even though Poland has
	been treated relatively brutally and cruelly there was a large sentiment among Polish citizens to aid
	the Nazi German body to exterminate Jews (Friedberg, 2018). Prior to the second world war Jews
	were formally excluded from specific parts of the public area. <br/><br/>

	This suffering enabled the Law and Justice to latch onto the sentiment that Polish should not be
	blamed for enabling the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany. Outlawing such blame is necessary
	for the country's integrity and reputation (Shepp, 2018). Even though the anti semitic dogma was
	highly present in Poland prior to the second world war (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,
	2015). The narrative from the Law and Justice party does not shed light on the negative side of the
	Polish government in the second world war and the interbellum prior to that. President Andrzej
	Duda passed a law that can result in up to three years of imprisonment for “publicly and
	untruthfully assigning responsibility or co-responsibility to the Polish Nation or the Polish State for
	Nazi crimes.” This shows how far the government is willing to go to censor academics, journalists
	and others..<br/><br/>

	The party's official stance on history is that Poland was a victim of both Nazi and Soviet aggression
	during World War II and that the country played a heroic role in the war effort. The party
	emphasizes the bravery and sacrifice of the Polish resistance and emphasizes the suffering of Polish
	citizens during the war, including the massacre of civilians by the Germans in Warsaw. <br/><br/>

	The party has also been criticized for its controversial reforms to the country's judiciary, which
	opponents argue threaten the rule of law and the independence of the courts. The Law and Justice
	party has defended these reforms as necessary to fight corruption and ensure accountability in the
	justice system. Overall, the Law and Justice party's narrative on history is one that emphasizes
	Poland's suffering and heroism during World War II while downplaying its collaboration with Nazi
	authorities in the Holocaust. <br/><br/>

	Nowadays, the party advocates for a social market economy where the agricultural sector is
	quintessential. It formally opposes corruption, waste of public money and more integration in the
	European Union. Moreover, it is supported by the catholic church, promotes national and traditional
	values and is ideologically conservative (Gwiazda, 2021). Since the party was able to form a
	single-party majority it did not need to concur with other coalition parties and therefore was able to
	realize its election promises more easily. Having that said, the party did receive considerable
	support from the church as it mobilized its members to vote for the Law and Justice party and in
	this way secure the one-party ruling situation. It thus owes some sentiment to its constituencies
	even though they do not have to deal with a coalition. Which does not only consist of catholic
	believers but through various other mechanisms also out of voters with primary and vocational
	education, farmers, people over 50 and workers (Markowski, 2016) <br/><br/>

	<h3>The current debate</h3>

	The European Union and Poland clash over the reforms of the justice system in Poland which has
	more political control than is believed to be ideal by the European set of norms and values. Since
	October 2021 Poland has had to pay 1 million per day to the European Union, sentenced by the
	Court of Justice of the European Union due to their reforms in the Polish judicial system, which
	concerns disciplinary mechanisms for judges. Moreover, the European Union is holding back 35
	billion in pandemic recovery money. With extremely high inflation, double the average of the
	European Union (5.2 % and 2.5% respectively) the political party needs the help of the European
	Union. This is putting pressure on the support of the political party. A 3rd term is therefore not as
	sure as the first two terms. Currently, these are the polls. (Cienski, 2023) <br/><br/>

	<center><i>Figure 1: Current polls of Polish political parties (Cienski, J. (2023, January 5))</i></center><br/><br/>

	In order for Poland to receive the EU pandemic funds it needs to alter its system for disciplining
	judges. It needs parliamentary backing from a far-right (eurosceptic) party to stay in power.
	Therefore the party cannot easily handle the situation. This has caused a lot of debate within the
	political environment. Nevertheless, as seen in the polls, the Russian invasion of Ukraine had a
	positive effect on the support for the party. Since the Law and Justice party supports Ukraine with
	many tangible resources, which has repaired some of its international status (Cienski, 2023) The
	Republic of Poland is a parliamentary democracy under the 1977 constitution (European
	Committee of the Regions, 2023) The parliament is bicameral and consists of an upper house, the
	Senate (Senat) and the lower house (Sejm). Its voter turnout is 61.7 % and the frequency of
	parliamentary elections is 4 years. A simple majority is enough to be the governing party, normally
	this is in the form of a coalition between more parties. <br/><br/>

	<h3>Populism and nationalism</h3>

	In order to establish whether the Law and Justice party can be deemed populist or nationalist, one
	first needs to define those concepts. Firstly, according to the European Centre for Populism Studies
	(2023), populism refers to a range of ideologies that emphasize the idea of the people and juxtapose
	this against the elite of a country. The latter is seen as evil and should be removed as it consumes all
	the resources the people have right to. This can be directly compared to the lines of the leader of the
	Law and Justice party: “After 2015, the socio-economic system changed a lot. The mechanism of
	exploiting a large part of society by a small, privileged part of society has been radically limited”
	(Tilles, 2023). It is therefore clear that the Law and Justice party uses populistic rhetoric. In its
	manifesto, the Law and Justice party claims: 'The nation is a community of culture, language,
	historical experience and political tradition [. . .] but is not defined in the ethnic sense”. The Polish
	nation was formed by people of different ethnicities (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, 2014). The
	opposition is the corrupt and privileged elite of Polish society. The nation builds upon the family as
	it passes through the core Polish values like catholicism, historical knowledge, patriotic attitudes
	and instilling a sense of national dignity. The Law and Justice party divides the nation into two
	antagonistic groups (Fomina and Kucharczyk, 2016): on the one hand, we have “true” poles who
	concur with the views of the catholic church, and patriotism and are believed to exhibit morality. On
	the other hand, the groups that are disapproved are the Russians, Germans, members of the
	LHBTQ+ community, former prime minister Tusk, immigrants, communists and parties opposing
	the Law and Justice party (Fomina and Kucharczyk, 2016). Alongside the idea to juxtapose the 'true'
	Polish people against groups that are disapproved, are nationalistic tendencies that are often paired
	with populistic parties. While both are different concepts, nationalism and populism are often
	closely related to each other. Many prominent examples of populist politics have been nationalist,
	and nationalistic politicians often feature a populist component (De Cleen, 2017). Both concepts
	revolve around the sovereignty of 'the people'. <br/><br/>

	<h3>Warsaw Uprising</h3>

	Now that we have defined populism and nationalism and have determined that the Law and Justice
	party shows signs of both of these concepts, we are almost able to answer our research question by
	examining the narrative of the Warsaw Uprising Museum. However, before moving on to the
	Warsaw Uprising Museum and its narrative and exhibits, it is necessary to provide a short, general
	description of the Warsaw Uprising, which is the aim of this section. <br/><br/>

	The Warsaw Uprising was a major military operation by the Polish resistance during World War II
	that aimed to liberate Warsaw from Nazi occupation. An additional goal of the Home Army (the
	name of the Polish resistance forces) was to try and prevent the Soviets from acquiring Warsaw and
	Poland for their communist regime (Davies, 2003), as they were aiming to turn Poland into a
	capitalist country. Hence, the Home Army had planned to work with the Western allies when they
	would inevitably liberate Europe. However, as the war progressed, it became more and more clear
	that it would be the Soviets that were to liberate Poland from the Germans.<br/><br/>

	The timing of the Warsaw Uprising was no coincidence; it happened while the German forces were
	retreating from the Soviet forces that were approaching from the east. However, when the Warsaw
	Uprising occurred, the Soviets did not succeed in supporting the Polish forces. When it became clear
	that the Soviets would not be helping the Polish forces (who were short on resources, (Davies
	(2003)), the Western Allies tried to support the rebellion by means of supply drops by aeroplanes
	(Davies, 2003). Nevertheless, this proved to be too little, too late, and the Warsaw Uprising failed,
	leading to a lot of civilian casualties and a Warsaw that was reduced to rubble. <br/><br/>

	The narrative spread by the Law and Justice party, in this regard, is that the Soviets halted their
	march on purpose, to enlarge their chances of incorporating Warsaw and Poland into their
	communist regime with the least amount of effort possible, as the resistance would then have been
	taken out by the Germans. However, this is something that is currently still debated. Multiple
	sources (Davies, 2003 & Glantz, 2001) report that it may not be completely true that the Soviets
	purposefully decided not to support the Uprising, with Glantz (2001) mentioning the following:
	'Political considerations and motivations aside, an objective consideration of combat in the Warsaw
	region indicates that, prior to early September, German resistance was sufficient to halt any Soviet
	assistance to the Poles in Warsaw, was it intended' (p.84). This illustrates that even if the Soviets
	would have wanted to, it would have been very difficult for them to engage. More on this, and more
	on how the Law and Justice party uses the Warsaw Uprising Museum to spread its own narrative in
	general, will follow in the section on the Warsaw Uprising Museum.<br/><br/>

	<h3>Warsaw Uprising Museum</h3>

	Now that the reader is familiar with the Warsaw Uprising itself, we can move on to the Warsaw
	Uprising Museum. First, in this section, a short description of the museum itself is provided. After
	that, attention will be given to the documents and the initiation of the museum, and lastly, the
	narrative of the museum will be discussed. <br/><br/>

	The Warsaw Uprising Museum is a historical museum located in Warsaw, Poland that
	commemorates the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. It was opened in 2004, on the 60th anniversary of the
	Warsaw Uprising, and is housed in a former tram power station. Its exhibits cover the history of the
	uprising, including its planning, execution, and aftermath, as well as the daily life of Warsaw
	residents during the war.<br/><br/>

	The museum's exhibits include photographs, films, and artefacts such as weapons, uniforms, and
	personal items of the insurgents and civilians. One of the most notable exhibits is a replica of a
	street in Warsaw during the uprising, complete with the sounds of gunfire and explosions.
	The museum also features a 3D movie that provides a multimedia overview of the events of the
	uprising, as well as a section dedicated to the cultural and artistic life of Warsaw during the war.
	The Warsaw Uprising Museum is a popular destination for visitors to Warsaw, attracting both local
	and international tourists interested in learning more about the Warsaw Uprising. The narrative of
	the museum serves as a powerful reminder of the courage and sacrifice of the Polish resistance
	during World War II and the enduring spirit of the Polish people in the face of adversity. However,
	simultaneously, the narrative of the Law and Justice party (which includes the lack of support by the
	Soviets and lack of resources in general mentioned, as mentioned in the previous section) is really
	emphasized in the museum, and this paper will elaborate further on this narrative in the section on
	the narrative of the Warsaw Uprising museum, but only after a short discussion about the
	documents and the initiation of the museum. <br/><br/>

	<h3>Documents & initiation of the Museum</h3>

	When the first exhibition of the Warsaw Uprising Museum was finished in 2006, it already
	communicated a sense of national pride and patriotism (Zychlińska & Fontana, 2016). The
	importance of the Polish historical consciousness of the Warsaw Rising, along with the victimization
	of Polish people in general, was the driving force behind the establishment of the museum back in
	2004. The museum was decided to be established by then-mayor Lech Kaczryński, who was the first
	chairman of the Law & Justice party when the party was founded in 2001. During the creation of the
	museum, young people were identified as the primary target group. Because of this, the originators
	of the museum aimed to make the museum appealing to youngsters' sense of aesthetics (Zychlińska
	& Fontana, 2016). Before building the museum, the creators visited several museums that are
	known for their interactive, innovative, and narrative manners in presenting history which engage
	visitors emotionally. The documents from the creation of the museum state that the museum should
	“above all, and from the very beginning, avoid museal boredom” (Zychlińska & Fontana, 2016). <br/><br/>

	When looking at the exhibition design when the museum was created, the first thing that can be
	noticed is that the museum features ordinary people during the rising, rather than only military or
	political leaders. The museum portrays their pursuits, hopes, and anxieties (Zychlińska & Fontana,
	2016). What creates a sense of national pride and patriotism, is the museum's presentation of the
	fate of these ordinary people. As is apparent in the original documents of the museum, a clear
	message needs to be communicated: these individuals chose to risk their lives to save their country
	(Zychlińska & Fontana, 2016). All in all, the original documents support the national pride that
	needs to be presented in the museum: the Warsaw Uprising is described as an exceptional event in
	human history, not only Polish history, which represents a decision to fight for the highest human
	ideal, freedom, in insurmountable circumstances (Zychlińska & Fontana, 2016). <br/><br/>

	<h3>Narrative of the museum</h3>

	The emphasis of the Warsaw Uprising museum is on illustrating the bravery of the Polish people, or,
	more specifically, the participants in the Warsaw Uprising. Simultaneously, a more hidden objective
	of the museum is to stimulate a sense of nationalism among Polish visitors. There is an undertone of
	nationalism in almost every exhibition, which may subconsciously trigger the average Polish
	visitors' sense of nationalism. Even to visitors like the authors of this paper, who visited this
	museum with politics as their main focus, most of the ways in which the museum subconsciously
	stimulates a sense of solidarity and nationalism only became clear in a group discussion that
	occurred at a later point in time. One can imagine that if even such an audience fails to recognize
	this during their visit, then it must be even harder to grasp for the average Polish visitor, who is just
	visiting the museum for its representation of history. An example of this is the following; the
	museum features a screen that matches you with a Polish hero from the Warsaw Uprising, based on
	your appearance, which the device scans while determining who to match you with. For the average
	Polish visitor, this can stimulate nationalism in a really subtle way, by creating some feeling of
	common identity with the Polish heroes who fought or helped during the Warsaw Uprising. In the
	meantime, the average Polish visitor might just see this device as an interesting device that gives
	him/her a unique experience that they will likely not find in other museums. Hence, it conveys a
	sense of nationalism and common identity in a very devious way; if even the authors of this paper
	did not realize this immediately, then what is to be expected of the average Polish visitor? <br/><br/>

	Next to this, a feeling of nationalism and heroism among the Polish visitors was also conveyed
	through the Polish war tune that played repeatedly in the elevator. Additionally, the guide and the
	texts kept referring to the Polish people who participated in the Uprising by using the word 'we' and
	multiple parts of the museum were specifically designed to show how hard the circumstances were
	for the Polish people. What particularly stood out to us was the representation of the sewer through
	which the participants of the Uprising had to go on a daily basis. This sewer is really small and dark,
	and the visitors are encouraged to try and walk/crawl through this sewer. In this way, the visitors
	who decide to do this, experience what the Polish people had to go through on a daily basis during
	the Warsaw Uprising. Indirectly, this might lead to (even) more appreciation for the participants in
	the Uprising, by putting a lot of emphasis on how hard the things they had to go through were. <br/><br/>

	It is reported that these sewers were also used by child soldiers, who played an important role in
	the Warsaw Uprising (Stańczyk, 2015). Corroborating this, the Warsaw Uprising museum features a
	place where young children can play, in which all toys are related to the role of Polish children in the
	Warsaw Uprising (Stańczyk, 2015; Michta, 2020). Furthermore, the following is noted by Michta
	(2020): 'at the center of the room stands a life-size figure of a child insurgent, (...) clutching a (...)
	submachine gun produced by the Home Army' (p.207). This room may be the most striking example
	of stimulating a feeling of nationalism among the Polish visitors, as making children play with toys
	related to the Uprising and displaying a child soldier in the children's playing room stimulates their
	feeling of belonging before they even have the ability to critically reflect on this. <br/><br/>

	Furthermore, one could also constantly hear the sound of a pounding heart inside the museum. This
	intensifies the entire experience, by creating some feeling of urgency. Besides this, it is also
	constantly mentioned by the guide that the difference in military power was immense. Hence, the
	Polish people must have been really brave to have tried to overcome such a difference. Even though
	this is true and also relevant, from an objective point of view there is no need to keep mentioning
	this; mentioning this once or twice would provide the visitors with the same amount of information. <br/><br/>

	Next to that, the guide constantly referred to the fact that the Western countries could (and should)
	have done more than they actually did during the second world war. Even though this may be the
	case in some circumstances, it is questionable how realistic this would be. For example, it is
	mentioned that, at the start of the war, Poland thought they would be liberated by Western forces
	instead of the Russians. In our opinion, this is not at all realistic, because Poland is located to the
	East of Germany, which implies that the Western forces would have to either take a huge detour
	before going to Germany, or that they would have to continue fighting after taking down the
	Germans. <br/><br/>

	Additionally, it was mentioned that ''only'' 20 percent of air supplies dropped by the Western
	countries that were destined for the Polish during the Warsaw Uprising actually ended up in their
	hands. However, when one applies a more objective view to this, one should also emphasize the
	circumstances under which these air supplies had to take place. For example, it was very hard to
	determine where to drop the supplies and, after that, to actually drop them in the correct place, due
	to obvious reasons like flying over enemy territory. However, this was never mentioned by the guide
	during the tour through the museum. In our opinion, this example further illustrates the point that
	the narrative of the Polish being heroes is stimulated in a sometimes unrealistic way (having even
	fewer resources because the Western countries were not even able to drop all of them in the correct
	places). <br/><br/>

	It is, however, also important to remember that not everything in the museum is stimulating a
	feeling of nationalism/heroism in an unrealistic manner or a devious way. For example, a virtual
	reality movie was shown to us, which displayed the state in which the Germans left Warsaw. In this
	movie, one could observe that a very large proportion of the city was simply wiped from the earth.
	This is neither unrealistic, nor devious; this is just one of the many things that are part of the Polish
	identity no matter what. <br/><br/>

	Concluding this section, one can definitely say that the narrative of the Warsaw Uprising museum is
	constituted in such a way that it (sometimes deviously) creates a feeling of belonging and
	nationalism/heroism to the average Polish visitor. <br/><br/>

	<h3>Literature on the museum and memory politics in Poland</h3>

	Now that we have developed the narratives of the Law and Justice Party and the Warsaw Uprising
	Museum, we can move on to the final part of this paper, where we compare our findings to those of
	the literature. <br/><br/>

	Since the Law & Justice party came to power, there have been several articles written on the
	changed narrative of the Warsaw Uprising Museum. Many of these articles argue that the Law &
	Justice party is deliberately shaping Polish history and its memory to push it towards a narrative
	they use to create moral superiority.<br/><br/>

	One key article addresses the victimization of the Polish people through the museum, and argues
	that several changes made in the museum are solely to emphasize Poland's victimhood and
	resistance to foreign domination, rather than using the museum for displaying the Warsaw Uprising
	itself (Cadier & Szulecki, 2020). Furthermore, they argue that the Law & Justice party pushes this
	narrative, next to the continuous reminding Germany of its Nazi past, in an attempt to acquire a
	more favorable position of moral superiority in place of moral inferiority. To create this moral
	superiority, Polish resistance fighters are portrayed heavily as heroes, while the bad guys, Germany,
	are heavily portrayed as villains. The obsessive rejection of Germany and its Nazi past and the
	reminding of this is rooted in the changes made in the museum since the Law & Justice Party is in
	power. The Law and Justice Deputy Minister of Culture Jarosław Selling argues that “changes were
	necessary because the original exhibition purportedly adopted a German point of view” (Siddi and
	Gaweda, 2019). Undoubtedly, painting off Nazi-Germany as the bad guys can not be seen as a crime
	in any situation, however, the museum's new structure offers a tale of absolutes: “AK fighters
	(fighters of the Polish Home Army) as quintessentially patriotic, and their enemies, Nazi's and
	communists, as unequivocally evil” (Michta, 2020). <br/><br/>

	The attempt of reminding the Polish people of its heroic past could only be put into action since the
	party rose to power in 2015, however, the idea that the so-called “post-solidarity elites”, arguably
	made of mostly left-wing politicians, have deprived the Poles of their national pride has been
	around longer in the Law & Justice party. In 2004 the head of the party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said the
	following: “In the 1990s I had watched the nation's identity decline. I mean not only a turn away
	from its own history and memory but even wave of aversion to the national past.”
	(Kurkowska-Budzan, 2006). It became a main focus for the Law & Justice party, as Michta (2020)
	argues: “The party's reliance on historical policy, especially the Kaczyńskis' focus on Poland's
	victimization during the 20th century as the foundation of their populist activism, would give the
	Law and Justice party a sui generis quality”. Furthermore, this view on history institutes social
	cohesion, moral unity, and cultural homogeneity (Michta, 2020). The same patriotic view is also
	used by the Law and Justice party when approaching European politics. In 2005, Kazcyński
	criticized the EU for “attempting to impose the identity of stronger nations onto smaller nations''
	(Kazcynski, 2005). At this time, Kaczyński was the leader of the main opposition party in Poland,
	and his view on memory politics was contrary to the view of the liberals, whose approach was to
	align with the Western-dominated narratives. By not challenging these narratives, Poland sought to
	find a role in Europe as “a loyal and determined ally of democracy” (Clarke and Duber, 2018). As a
	result, a political battle over the scope of museums was initiated. In 2004, Kazcyński created the
	Warsaw Uprising Museum during his time as mayor of Warsaw. The museum “seeks to celebrate the
	martyrdom of Polish nationalist forces resisting German occupation in the summer of 1944” (Clarke
	and Duber, 2018, p.5). Countering this, Civic Platform leader Donald Tusk initiated the Museum of
	the Second World War in Gdansk, which could be seen as a reply to Kaczyński's museum (Clarke and
	Duber, 2018). Kaczyński's brother, Jaroslaw, was quick to respond to Tusk's museum, deeming it a
	capitulation to a Western European view of the war. Jaroslaw pointed out the mere convenience of
	adopting this view in the museum after Tusk had just become president of the European Council,
	being appointed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (Clarke and Duber, 2018). However, Tusk's
	view on this museum fits the “liberal” model of historical memory policy, which argues that the
	state should have a neutral stance in matters of creating museums. This can be seen in his
	compliance with the creator of the museum, historian Pawel Machcewicz. Tusk did not impose any
	restrictions on how Machcewicz should direct the museum. According to Machcewicz, the role of
	the state should be to stimulate the institutions to deal with history, as opposed to what the Law
	and Justice party seeks: “managing the past” (Clarke and Duber, 2018). <br/><br/>

	Peters (2016) also sheds light on the way in which the Law and Justice Party is trying to turn history
	into political propaganda. In his paper, it is mentioned that 'An amendment to the Institute of
	National Remembrance law (...) makes the head of the institute directly responsible to the political
	will of the parliamentary majority' (p.2). This is perhaps one of the most striking examples of how
	the Law and Justice party is trying (and has succeeded) to turn Poland's history into something
	political, rather than something objective and independent of politics. In the words of Peters (2016)
	'The changes stipulated by the new amendment will once again politicize the Institute of National
	Remembrance and marginalize the role of historical scholarship at the institute' (p.3). Among other
	things, the institute's president is now chosen by the Polish parliament instead of the board of the
	institute and the advisory board of the institute has been replaced with a council made up of
	members selected by the president of Poland together with the Polish parliament. Peters (2016),
	describes the consequences in the following way: 'The influence of historical scholarship on the
	directors of the institute, which had guaranteed its independence from politics in recent years, has
	thus been fully eliminated' (p.3). Hence, the task of the Institute has changed from independent
	research to the implementation of the political view of history. Peters (2016) quotes the initiator of
	the aforementioned amendment in the following way: the Institute of National Remembrance is to
	be refashioned into an 'effective unit of creating Polish identity, of building up pride in Polish
	history' (p.3). Michta (2020) argues that this practice of altering the narrative of Polish history has
	been applied to the Warsaw Uprising Museum as well, and quotes Dłużewska (2015) about this:
	'[the museum] remodel[ed] Polish national memory (…) which increasingly focuses on one event
	through which we explain the entire history of the nation (...) the Warsaw Uprising Museum took
	this practice to the next level' (p. 203-204).<br/><br/>

	Furthermore, Peters (2016) notes that it is very clear that the Law and Justice party aims to change
	the objective of museums from representing Polish history in an objective manner to reducing it to a
	narrative of the heroism of the Polish people. Additionally, according to Peters (2016) 'the ultimate
	aim of the new government is to question the version of Polish history portraying a peaceful victory
	over communism by a pluralist opposition movement' (p.4). Next to this, the Law and Justice party
	are also using this change in narrative to damage the reputation of the non-right-wing
	anti-communists of the 1980s. This once again shows how the Law and Justice party is using the
	narrative of Polish history to push its agenda. <br/><br/>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>

	Since its creation in 2001, the Law & Justice party has used its national-conservative ideology to
	establish itself as a dominant party in Poland. The party has faced criticism both domestically and
	internationally, as controversial reforms to the judiciary have raised concerns about the rule of law
	and the independence of the courts. As a result, the European Union has imposed multiple financial
	penalties, with the aim to put pressure on the party and their support. The party's narrative on
	history, which highlights Poland's suffering and heroism during the Second World War, has been
	used to create moral superiority in order to impose nationalism on the Polish population. One
	powerful tool for distributing information to create this moral superiority is through museums. The
	Warsaw Uprising Museum, established by the party itself, serves as a symbol of national pride and
	patriotism. The museum's designs and exhibits aim to emotionally engage Polish citizens, for
	example through a digital mirror which matches visitors with a Polish hero from the uprising, to
	push the narrative of the bravery and sacrifice of the Polish people during the Warsaw Uprising. <br/><br/>

	Critics argue that the emotional stimulation of national pride through the museum is merely an
	attempt by the Law & Justice party to manipulate Polish memory of historical events for political
	gain. The museum's perspective aligns with the party's nationalistic agenda. Furthermore, this
	suspicion can be backed by the organizational changes made in the museum. The Institute of
	National Remembrance's president is now chosen by parliament and independent historical
	scholars are eliminated in the process of redefining museums. Critics argue that alternative
	viewpoints can be eliminated this way. Additionally, complex historical events are oversimplified
	and perpetuated as 'black-and-white views' with the ultimate motive to place a psychological
	aversion against the portrayed 'villains' of the Warsaw Uprising, namely the Germans and the
	Soviets. This practice ignores nuances of the past, limiting the potential for a true understanding of
	Poland's role, in order to reinforce a sense of nationalism and patriotism.<br/><br/>

	Hence, the research question <i>'How is the narrative of Polish history (or more specifically, the
	narrative told by the Warsaw Uprising museum) used by the Law & Justice party to push its agenda
	and stimulate nationalism?'</i> can be answered in the following way: The Law & Justice party uses the
	narrative of Polish history (and specifically the narrative of the Warsaw Uprising museum) to create
	a feeling of bravery and belonging among the Polish people, and hence stimulates nationalism in
	this way.`;
