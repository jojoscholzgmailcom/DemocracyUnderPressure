	How does the populist Polish government instrumentalise cultural and educational
	institutions to reinforce the narrative propagated by its memory laws to reshape Polish
	Identity?

	
	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	In 2018, the Polish Law and Justice Party (PiS) passed the 'Amendment to the Act on the Institute
	of National Remembrance', which prescribed a certain account of Polish history, and called for
	punishment for accusing the Polish state and people of involvement and responsibility for the
	Nazi occupation during World War II. The adoption of this law caused widespread public
	controversy and was met with international criticism, being called an “attempt to rewrite history”
	(Staff, 2018). The amendment is an example of so-called 'memory laws', which are intended to
	prescribe a certain interpretation of historical events. They are preponderantly enacted as an
	anxious reaction to preserve national and cultural identity (Soroka&Krawatzek, 2019). <br/><br/>

	In his statement regarding the 'Holocaust Law', the prime minister of Poland underlined the
	importance of attributing blame to the real perpetrators instead of letting it fall upon its victims.
	The law was amended one year later, but it stands to prove the point of intention to rewrite Polish
	history. It was, however, just one of the efforts of the PiS party to induce a selective sense of
	Polish identity, built on omissions and single-perspective views on historical events. In parallel,
	the government also established a number of museums and exhibitions to actively promote their
	interpretation of Polish history. These include the Warsaw Uprising Museum, the Ulma Family
	Museum of Poles Saving Jews in World War II, the Museum of the Second World War and the
	European Solidarity Centre. <br/><br/>

	Simultaneously, the Polish educational system has been overhauled and now actively promotes
	Polish heroism and innocence through omission and reinterpretation (Ambrosewicz-Jacobs &
	Szuchta, 2014). The educational institutions of a state have the role of institutionalizing beliefs in
	its citizens from a young age, and thus, the sources this paper will examine will look at the effect
	of selective historical education in Poland, and its common themes with the ideas of the PiS
	party. All of these constitute a manifestation of the memory laws, by which the PiS party
	attempts to propagate its prescribed interpretation of Polish history.<br/><br/>

	In the following, this essay shall examine the features of theoretical memory laws that apply to
	the particular case of Poland and the way these are diffused through the cultural and educational
	institutions so that the reinterpretation of history becomes an inherent feature of Polish identity.
	Apart from analyzing literature concerned with the topic, the paper will present a primary
	qualitative analysis in the form of a small number of short, semi-structured interviews in which
	we aim to understand the elements Polish people feel are part of their identity and the ways in
	which they showcase the propagation of a selective version of history. Thus, we aim to answer
	the question: <b>How does the populist Polish government instrumentalise cultural and
	educational institutions to reinforce the narrative propagated by its memory laws to
	reshape Polish Identity?</b> <br/><br/>

	<h4>Memory laws</h4>
	The most important concept to define for the scope of this paper is memory laws, and the ways
	in which they act to shape the narrative of a nation. To define them is not an easy task, as it is
	difficult to differentiate whether they are laws in the true and narrow sense of the word, namely
	whether they impose certain regulations and confer certain freedoms to legal parties, or whether
	they remain mere statements made by lawmakers (Bachmann et al., 2021). Still, Belavusau and
	Gliszczyńska-Grabias (2017) define them broadly as acts aiming to enshrine state-approved
	interpretations of crucial national historical events, in the sense that they are prescriptive and
	allow for reference to an event in an officially sanctioned way (Soroka&Krawatzek, 2019).
	Memory laws can be enacted by the government with the purpose of promoting exaggerated
	national heroism or resistance or banning the existence of crimes. In either case, they create a
	body of law- and state-protected knowledge, which removes certain events from the realm of
	historical dispute (Bachmann et al., 2021). This will inherently create tension between the law's
	purpose and the 3 most important elements endorsed by liberal democrats, namely free speech,
	press freedom and academic freedom.<br/><br/>

	One of the largest issues with memory laws is that academics have so far not found any
	correlation between the severity of sanctions or the probability of states imposing them and the
	significance, amplitude, or overall damage associated with the historical event concerned. This
	implies that the enactment of a memory law is much rather a visualization of the character of the
	state in question, rather than of the historical event itself (Pettai, 2020). That fact that a state
	deems it necessary to prescribe one specific account of history might therefore be more
	significant than the actual content of the memory law or the magnitude of the historical event to
	be remembered. Memory laws concerning the Holocaust range from 'self-inculpatory', whereby
	a state actively acknowledges the severity of the holocaust and the potential responsibilities it
	had therein, such as Holocaust denial laws present in Israel and some European countries, to
	'self-exculpatory' (Heinze, 2019), whereby a state's involvement in the holocaust is played down
	and relativised. The Polish memory laws are showcasing an example of the latter, implying that
	those who knowingly inculcate the state stand to receive punishment.<br/><br/>

	Memory laws are not unique to Poland though. Multiple other European countries, including
	France, Germany and Spain also enact this type of legislation. In France, for example, the denial
	or relativisation of the Holocaust and other recognised genocides is criminalized severely.
	Similarly, Germany's otherwise liberal laws of speech and expression are limited to the extent
	that a denial of the Holocaust is strictly forbidden and will be punished (Rhein-Fischer and
	Mensing, 2022). In Spain on the other hand, the memory laws in place serve to recognise the
	victims of the Spanish civil war and the subsequent Franco dictatorship (Nayler, 2022).
	However, as seen in the next paragraph, Poland has been more relentless in their formation and
	promotion.<br/><br/>

	The memory laws that have been adopted in Poland are not limited to the 'Amendment to the Act
	on the Institute of National Remembrance', which states that there can be no mention of 'Polish
	Death Camps' apart from scientific research into the war and artistic work, but rather they must
	be talked about using references to Nazi Germany, the Third German Reich, and occupied
	Poland (John, 2018). Individuals can be charged with up to three years in jail, should they
	nevertheless refer to the former concentration camps on Polish territory as 'Polish Death Camps'
	(Katz, 2018). Another example is the law adopted in 1947 by the Polish Government which
	epitomized Auschwitz as a site of 'martyrdom of the Polish Nation and other Nations', which
	aimed at blurring, if not abolishing the distinction between the fate of the Poles and that of the
	Jews (Kończal, 2020), which the next section will bring more insights on. Rather than only
	taking a strong stance in the face of connections with the Nazi regime, they outlaw the
	propagation of fascism and other totalitarian regimes, as many European Councils do, expanding
	the core of this ban to cover the propagation of ideas related to Stalinist and communist regimes
	(Belavusau, 2013). In 2006, an added article in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Poland
	stipulated that anyone that slanders the Polish name by associating it with any Nazi crimes could
	be imprisoned for up to 3 years. In 2016, under the PiS party, the de-communization law called
	for the removal of street names, buildings, objects, and public service devices that would
	propagate totalitarian regimes. In 2017, the law was amended to also include monuments (Law,
	2017). By introducing this law, the Institute of National Remembrance issued a number of names
	that those making reference to any totalitarian regime should be replaced with. This public
	institution, to which the paper will further refer, is one of the most powerful actors in rewriting
	the Polish narrative. Founded in 1998, it was specifically tasked with investigating the crimes of
	Nazi and Soviet regimes on the Polish nation and has since gained quasi-legislative powers
	(Belavusau, 2018).<br/><br/>

	The big difference noticeable in the formation of memory laws in Poland and across other
	countries of Eastern Europe as opposed to those enacted in Western Counties, is that Eastern
	European memory laws envision fascist and communist regimes as equally criminal -
	understandable given the historical experience - but they are meant to shift the entire blame for
	historical injustices entirely onto others, such as Nazi Germany and the USSR. In doing so, they
	victimize the past for the sake of the nation-state and use history as a means of national
	mobilization (Koposov, 2020). This is not in line with the 'old' memory laws of Western
	European countries, which were focused on ensuring the propagation of truth, but rather they
	install a culture of victimhood and self-victimization of national communities that view
	themselves as victims of Soviets, Nazis and even the West (Himka&Michlic, 2013), while
	completely omitting the fact that parts of these populations participated in both Nazist and
	communist atrocities. They are the opposite of what the EU sought to ensure by promoting such
	memory legislation. According to Koposov (2020), many Eastern European, and especially
	Polish memory laws are products of national populism, a concept covered in the upcoming
	section.<br/><br/>

	<h4>Conceptualizing populism</h4>
	Populism can be said to constitute an essentially contested concept, due to the widely differing
	usage and interpretations of the term. In its essential form, the term populism denotes an “appeal
	to 'the people' against both the established structure of power and the dominant ideas and values
	of the society.” Furthermore, it involves “some kind of revolt against the established structure of
	power in the name of the people” (Conovan, 1999). Populism can therefore be said to describe a
	dissociation of a 'pure people', the populus, from a corrupt and self-interested elite that does not
	sufficiently consider and represent the interests of said people (Mudde 2004, p. 543.).<br/><br/>

	In recent practice, however, the term populism has often been interpreted and applied in different
	ways, thereby overstretching the original meaning of the term. For example, it has regularly been
	associated exclusively with right-wing nationalism, thus suggesting that populism was something
	akin to a political ideology. According to the renowned populism researcher Cas Mudde
	however, populism should at best be seen as a 'thin-centered' ideology which can easily be
	combined with other ideologies such as communism, ecologism, nationalism or socialism
	(Mudde 1999 p. 544). In this view, populism is therefore not a single coherent ideology, but can
	rather be melded with other existing meta-ideologies to form a new form of combined ideology.
	This view has also been contested, however, with yet again other scholars claiming that populism
	should not be regarded as an ideology at all, but rather as a specific style of conducting politics.
	This interpretation stresses the performative act rather than its embodied content (Moffitt 2016).<br/><br/>

	What these interpretations share, however, is a generally negative connotation of populism. On
	the contrary, other scholars argue that a limited degree of populism is a positive phenomenon, as
	it reanimates the political debate and can be seen as an indicator of the vibrancy of democracy
	and as democratic enrichment (Crum et al, 2023). This is insofar as it promotes the democratic
	goal of making the government accountable and responsive to the wants and needs of the
	citizens. For this reason paper, we shall stick with the original conceptualization of populism
	however, denoting it as an appeal to the people against the establishment in the form of structures
	of power and dominant societal norms.<br/><br/>

	<h4>Polish perception of history</h4>
	In this section of the essay, we discuss the perception of the Poles in regard to the Holocaust
	through the illustration of a number of antecedent studies. We explore the attitudes of Polish
	individuals in regard to certain events that took place during the Second World War, and infer
	general trends yielded from these attitudes, such as extreme nationalism and denial in regard to
	proven and undoubtable facts.<br/><br/>

	According to LaCapra (2001), memory and history are never perfectly aligned, with memory
	meant to come second in this case, due to the traumatic experiences that can motivate the
	alteration of history for the benefit of those remembering. In other words, it is often that
	individuals twitch history to their liking, not only stemming from manipulative reasons, but also
	as a result of generation trauma that they unconsciously aim to minimize.<br/><br/>

	First and foremost, according to empirical studies, such as that of Ambrosewicz-Jacobs (2003),
	there is a myriad of rival attitudes among young Poles with regard to the issue of suffering, and
	victimization. Some studies even point out that a great part of Poles believe that Polish suffering
	during WWII may not be sufficiently acknowledged as long as Jewish suffering is highlighted.
	The strong desire of Polish people to be considered partakers in the suffering experienced
	especially by Jews, Roma and other nationalities and ethnicities in concentration camps on
	Polish soil is believed to be born due to the alleged conspiracy launched by West Germany in the
	'60s, which called Poles antisemites who had welcomed the Holocaust (Kończal, 2020). As
	mentioned previously, one possible or usual explanation for narrative changing is to reverse a
	specific narrative by exaggerating the alternative. To combat this campaign, the Polish
	communist state established stories about Poles helping and rescuing their Jewish neighbours.
	However, the narrative that resulted was not only built on lies and exaggerations, but featured
	Jews as being passive during the war and ungrateful to Poles, if not even anti-Polish
	((Irwin-Zarecka, 1989).<br/><br/>

	In general, as will be discussed in the next section, Polish history is not propagated in its entirety,
	rather keeping the focus on those events and actions that place Poles in a favorable light. The
	book written by Jan Tomasz Gross (2021), about the massacre of Jews in Jedwabne raised
	intense national debates for over one year, in which the image of Poles was either seen as that of
	heroes or victims. It was argued that Jews had collaborated with the Soviets, thus being on the
	opposing side, and questions arose as to the implication of the Germans in either conducting the
	massacre, or influencing the Poles to do so.. The following report investigating the massacre, led
	by the prosecutor Radosław Ignatiew, and released by the Institute of National Remembrance,
	states that the involvement of Poles was 'decisive' in the crimes committed. Although the
	German Nazis were the catalyst of the crimes, the massacre was planned and executed by 40
	Polish nationals (Ambrosewicz-Jacobs & Szuchta, 2014). Kosiewski (2008) states that Poles
	have difficulties integrating such information into their consciousness, as it challenges their
	national identity as victims. As a result, in a nationwide survey conducted by said author, only
	7% of participants believed that Poles alone committed the crime and 14% that Poles alongside
	Germans did. The rest did not inculpate Polish nationals at all.<br/><br/>

	These empirical findings gathered by other authors have the purpose to present the difficulties
	Poles are met with when it comes to challenging their national identity as victims, even when the
	challenging information is factual and undoubtable. In the following section, we explore the
	educational system in Poland, thus looking for the root of this national identity. We consider that
	this kind of survey results have a lot to do with the identity assumed by Poles, and thus, we wish
	to dive into the ways a ruling body can influence the building of national identity.<br/><br/>

	<h4>The Polish educational system</h4>
	As a result of the 2007 parliamentary election, the first educational reform since 1989 was
	brought in regard to Holocaust references in schools. Namely, the topic was moved from the
	Middle School curriculum to the high school one, introduced in the 'contemporary patriotism'
	section and new textbooks were introduced as a result of the reform (Ambrosewicz-Jacobs &
	Szuchta, 2014).<br/><br/>

	Of the 8 history textbooks recommended for use by the Ministry of Education,
	Ambrosewicz-Jacobs and Szuchta (2014) analyse 7, and find that the 2-3 classes dedicated to the
	Holocaust cover between 0.8 and 2.8% of their total content. The Jedwabne massacre mentioned
	previously is not part of any of the textbooks (Ambrosewicz-Jacobs & Szuchta, 2014).
	Additionally, the analysis of the books has also uncovered that the Jewish fate at the time was
	presented as the Polish fate, overlapping them (Ambrosewicz-Jacobs & Szuchta, 2014). This is
	also confirmed by the authors of this essay, as read in 'The Fighting Republic of Poland'
	(Korkuc, 2019), which is available in multiple languages on the website of the Institute of
	National Remembrance, presumably the most vetted and truth-incapsulating work on the history
	of the Holocaust and of Poland.<br/><br/>

	In 2003, a group of researchers affiliated with the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw
	proposed a new direction of study which would incorporate the facts related to the groups of
	ethnic Poles that collaborated with Germans in carrying out the Holocaust. They were faced with
	opposition from historians affiliated with the Institute of National Remembrance, and the debate
	that arose was supported also by right-wing politicians, especially those of the ruling Law and
	Justice party (Ambrosewicz-Jacobs & Szuchta, 2014). These more traditional, nationalist
	scholars and politicians defended the propagation of 'affirmative histography' (which promotes
	exclusively praise-worthy historical facts).<br/><br/>

	The widely accepted Polish narrative that portrays the unity and strength of Poles in the face of
	foreign oppressors has led to the creation of a strongly supported nation-centric, rather than a
	state-centric view of Polish people on their country. What this implies is that they focus on the
	Polish people rather than on the Polish government and institutions. This is in line with the
	characteristics of populist parties and populist rhetorics in general. An effect of that is that 52.7%
	of respondents in a 2005 survey agreed with the statement 'People should support their country
	even if their country is in the wrong' (Bokszanski, 2005). Social collective memory has the
	pragmatic nature of allowing society to perceive itself as it wants to, rather than through
	objective reflection of the past (Milerski, 2010).<br/><br/>

	The overall conclusion of the discussion on the Polish educational system is that it aims to create
	a strong perception of heroism and affiliation with the suffering of less fortunate groups such as
	Jews and Roma and that it promotes affirmative historiography, thus creating a nation-centric
	view of Poland. The effect of this narrative is in line with populist rhetoric, which might be a
	valid explanation for the success of the PiS party, which adopted the strategy of maximizing
	specifically this nationalism for the purpose of seizing power. According to PiS leader Jarosław
	Kaczyński, “Young Poles' schooling should reflect pride and dignity, 'not shame' as it did thus
	far” (Radonic, 2020), which is vividly represented in the education reforms enacted by the
	government. This attempt to reshape the national identity of Poland has also manifested itself in
	the creation of various state-owned museums, which are described next.<br/><br/>

	<h4>Museums</h4>
	After Poland joined the European Union in 2004, the country experienced a 'museum boom'
	which led to the creation of several highly funded and extensively marketed museums, including
	the Warsaw Uprising Museum, the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, the Museum
	of the Second World War and the European Solidarity Centre, both located in Gdansk (Krakus,
	2020). The accession to the European Union caused the emergence of a fundamental struggle of
	Polish identity, which was torn between regarding itself as a fully integrated European state and
	representing itself as a uniquely Polish, patriotic and catholic nation. The sentiment that the
	Polish accession to the European Union exchanged the historical German occupation and
	Russian hegemony for that of Brussels was not uncommon (Shields, 2015), which arguably
	contributed to the electoral success of the Law and Justice (PiS) party in 2015 (Krakus, 2020). <br/><br/>
	
	Once in power, the new government sought to reshape the essence of what it means to be Polish
	through various means including a revision of the school curriculum and the creation of
	aforementioned museums, which propagate a prescribed narrative of Polish history. As the
	curators of all public museums in Poland work under direction of the Minister of Culture and
	National Heritage, the museums are subject to increased politicization and the government has
	considerable control over the information conveyed (Krakus, 2020). This was made particularly
	apparent in 2016, when the PiS government ordered to replace the direction of the Museum of
	the Second World War after accusing it of “building a European identity at the cost of a national
	identity” (Machcewicz, 2017). Soon after the direction was changed, significant changes were
	made to the exposition, now prioritizing the Polish war experience and highlighting Polish
	heroism (Krakus, 2020).<br/><br/>

	Several critics have noted that these museums concentrate more on conveying a particular
	narrative of Polish history, focused on politics of identity and martyrdom of Polish society, rather
	than informing and educating its visitors about Polish history through open debate (Muller and
	Logemann, 2017). However, providing a truthful representation of events appears not to have
	been the intention of these museums in the first place, as one of the Warsaw Uprising Musuem's
	curators states that “Modern museum exhibitions should not strive to reconstruct the past
	'exactly as it was'. [...] [Instead,] it should introduce the atmosphere, provide the context and
	help the appreciation and understanding of historical objects” (Krakus, 2020). <br/><br/>

	Out of all the museums mentioned, the Warsaw Uprising museum arguably plays the most
	important role for the PiS party to propagate its account of Polish history, partially also because
	of the way the museum came into being. The idea to found the museum was initially proposed by
	the first PiS Chairman Lech Kaczyńsk in 2001, and once the PiS party had won the
	parliamentary elections in 2005, they decided to deploy memory politics as the central guideline
	for the national political strategy (Radovic, 2020). As the Warsaw Uprising Museum marked the
	first time this patriotic and heroic narrative of Poland was employed in a public museum, it lends
	itself as a prime example to analyze the PiS attempts to enforce their vision of the past onto the
	general public. <br/><br/>

	What is striking about the Warsaw Uprising Museum is that the focus is primarily put on the
	stories that are portrayed and, maybe even more importantly, the stories that are left out. The
	focus on the heroic conduct of the poles during the uprising and the intentional omittance of any
	negative or controversial aspects conveys the impression that in fact, Poland and Warsaw had
	actually won the battle. Similarly, the museum showcases detailed stories of individuals, thereby
	easily evoking sympathy. Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear however that only Poles are
	portrayed in such a sympathizing way, and that other demographic groups such as Jews, who
	likely were suffering the most, are marginalized in comparison (Radovic, 2020). <br/><br/>

	<h4>Methodology of primary qualitative analysis</h4>
	In order to better assess the efficiency of the Polish narrative building which aims to portray
	Poles as both heroes and victims and to reshape the national identity, this essay incorporates the
	design of a short semi-structured interview (appendix 1) with young Polish people aged below
	25, all but one having a foreign country of residence at the time of the interview. The goal of this
	interview is to further discuss the extent to which the observed attempts of memory laws and the
	educational and cultural institutions that reinforce them, alongside generally passed-down
	collective memory, have been successful in creating a highly nationalistic and proud sentiment in
	young Poles. This method of study is not sufficiently broad or in-depth to create a conclusion,
	but rather it aims to reinstate and reinforce the conclusions of empirical and theoretical studies
	presented in antecedent sections. Moreover, being a qualitative study, it grants the authors the
	possibility of conducting a sort of sentiment analysis, thus shedding light on the narrative
	propagated to younger generations, especially through the educational system, a topic which has
	already been analyzed. <br/><br/>

	The questions of the interview are structured as follows: initially, the interviewee is asked to
	describe, in a few words, the role of Poland in European history, as they perceive it. Secondly,
	we inquire about the narrative taught in school in regard to the Second World War, and more
	specifically, the Holocaust. From this, we build the next question referring to the impression of
	the respondent on the idea of being 'eternally occupied' and the perceived impact of this fact on
	Polish history and development. In the last 2 questions, the interview focuses on the perception
	of change among people's impressions following the Remembrance Act, and lastly, on the
	different perceptions held regarding institutional bodies like the EU and other European
	countries by the interviewees when they are in Poland, and subject to the Polish narrative and
	propaganda, and when they are in their current country of residence (not Poland). <br/><br/>

	The interview transcripts (Appendix 1) have been analyzed using Atlas.ti, a qualitative analysis
	tool, which allowed us to determine themes and main subjects across the interviewees' responses,
	and thus, be able to name the common elements referred to by the majority. <br/><br/>

	<h4>Analysis of interview results</h4>
	The analysis process started with coding the interviews, by allocating codes, or representative
	words/phrases to extracts of our interview transcripts. These have been categorized based on the
	meaning attributed by the respondent to specific phrases. We first used open coding, marking the
	essence of the interviewee's answers and giving them a name that would summarize their focus.
	Afterwards, we used axial coding, so we assigned every code to a “subgroup” that would
	incorporate all its elements under one name. For instance, many of the topics identified
	throughout the interviews referred to the narrative taught to the interviewees in school or the
	perceived effects of memory laws and cultural message manipulation. Therefore, these codes
	have been assigned to the subgroup 'narrative re-writing actions'. More on the topics identified
	to have the highest frequency and the conclusions we draw will be explained further. Lastly,
	these subgroups would lead to the main elements identified throughout the interviews, which
	encompasses all of their meaning. The assignment to this group is defined as selective coding
	and creates a general theme that incorporates all subthemes. Diagram 1 presents all codes and the
	sub-themes they have been assigned to. The subgroup that is, indeed, not encompassed in the
	overarching theme of 'Polish identity creation' is the 'Effect of exposure to non-Polish media'.
	The inclusion of this topic in the interview in the first place had the aim of seeing whether our
	interviewee's opinions differ in any way when exposed to international media and living in an
	international context. As seen in the diagram, one frequent code made reference to the EU's
	leniency on Poland considering the unlawful events in the past years, as well as increased
	awareness of multiple perspectives one can employ. <br/><br/>

	There is, however, a code that connects the subgroup 'Effect of exposure to non-Polish media' to
	the 'Narrative re-writing actions' subgroup, namely that of 'Polish involvement in the
	Holocaust'. One of the respondents did claim that through international media and access to
	more diverse resources, they have become aware of the role Poles played in the Holocaust,
	including the massacre discussed earlier, as well as the discrepancy created with the narrative
	promoted in the educational system. This was not a novel observation, but rather a confirmation
	of the antecedent empirical studies presented.<br/><br/>

	What is striking about the codes resulting from the interviews is the high proportion of negativist
	perspectives, in regard to foreign occupation and victimization, especially as responses to those
	questions that did not make reference to either. In terms of the foreign occupation inquiry, we
	have seen many instances in which the respondents referred to 'German death camps', which is
	precisely the only acceptable way of referring to them according to the Amendment, implying
	either conscious or unconscious compliance. These 2 elements are complemented by the
	narrative of innocence, which also largely plays into the creation of the Polish identity, with
	many mentions of the 'bravery of Polish people', 'keeping alive the Polish spirit', and other
	statements which hinted toward intense nationalism. In the words of one of our interviewees, 'on
	the new passport edition on the cover below the emblem, it will be written 'god, honour,
	fatherland''.<br/><br/>

	The set of these 3 subgroups and the concepts they embody is also part of history rewriting, as
	our interviewees mentioned: very limited knowledge of the Holocaust gained through public
	history education, and highly focused on the heroic role of Poles, the strong national identity
	built through remembrance events, parades, and memorials, finished off by the imposition of
	memory laws on mentions of 'Polish death camps', which, according to one of our respondents,
	was a very popular phrase before being forbidden. <br/><br/>

	<h4>Discussion</h4>
	It must be thoroughly discussed after such an analysis the difference between populism and
	nationalism and must be made clear that the authors of this paper do not intend to equalize the
	two. The Polish identity as defined through the means of this essay is highly focused on the
	visualization of its citizens as victims of foreign entities such as the Nazi Germans and the
	USSR, and on the portrayal of Poles as heroes during World War II, thus being attributed a
	highly positive role in European history. The striking fact is that the narrative described above is
	not only a result of perception analysis, but rather it is a promoted version of history. The
	analysis has resulted in conclusions made about the role education and cultural institutions play
	in propagating these ideas.<br/><br/>

	Of the cultural institutions, the Warsaw Uprising Museum arguably demonstrates PiS attempts to
	influence history most vividly. This is mainly due to the fact that the museum was initiated by
	the PiS party leader personally, and he therefore had a tangible influence on the composition of
	the museum. Furthermore, the fact that the government saw the need to dismiss museum
	directors and replace them with other directors that more closely align with the party's account of
	history shows how actively the PiS party is influencing the historiographical and cultural
	landscape of Poland. On the same note falls the discussion regarding the educational system.
	The affirmative historiography used by current history curriculums taught in middle school and
	high school is being promoted specifically by right-wing politicians and members of the PiS, and
	thus, represents the will of the populist party. However, the connection between the PiS party and
	the narrative manipulation discussed in this essay is not based solely on such factual information.
	Rather, the authors connect the type of narrative that is propagated with the core ideas of
	populism, as follows. The ideas of a strong national identity which is reinforced by positions of
	victimhood, as well as heroism have the common factor of an oppressor and the separation of the
	people from this undesirable elite or ruling group. Secondly, the juxtaposition between the faith
	of the Poles and that of the Jews during the Holocaust has the powerful effect of situating the
	Poles among the non-elite and oppressed groups. And lastly, the development of the
	nation-centric view of Poland aids the propagation of populism through the orientation of the
	nationalism of Poles towards the unity among its citizens, rather than towards the actual
	decisions of the heads of state. In this manner, the behaviour and decisions of the populist party
	become of less importance than the pride of being Polish that they promote.<br/><br/>

	Much of the narrative shift that is persuading this version of national identity, however, appears
	to be Poland-centric, as our interviewees have admitted to being able to change this narrow view
	when being subjected to international media, thus even leaning towards the belief that the EU is
	being much too lenient with Poland in light of recent events. <br/><br/>

	Even though the authors of this paper do not claim a necessary causal relationship between the
	account of Polish history propagated by the PiS and the responses to the interview, their
	accordance is too salient to be ignored and unlikely to have occurred due to random chance. For
	instance, the fact that all respondents referred to the concentration camps as 'German Death
	Camps', a term that had rarely been used before the PiS started prescribing it, vividly
	demonstrates the obvious effect the enacted memory laws have on the common parlance of
	young Poles. The authors therefore believe that the memory laws enacted by PiS have been
	efficacious to the extent that they do have a tangible effect on the mnemonic culture in Poland,
	and did factually influence the way that Polish history and national identity is perceived among
	Poles. <br/><br/>

	<h4>Conclusion</h4>
	The research question aimed to be answered by this research paper concerns the way in which
	the main characteristics of the populist party act as a spill-over into the cultural institutions in
	Poland, thus re-iterating the separation between the 'people' and the undesirable elite through
	means such a mainstream education (in the form of teachable material) and widely open cultural
	centres and museums. The argument made by the authors is that memory laws are just the
	surface of Polish narrative re-writing actions and that the intention to create a 'correct' version of
	events has been installed in other national institutions as well. The enactment of those memory
	laws is vividly demonstrated by the changing museum landscape and recent changes in the
	school curriculum, which have all been realigned with the PiS parties heroic narratives about the
	Polish nation. Since the aim of a memory law, as presented above, is to propagate a selective
	view of history, it usually entails either the exaggeration of heroism or that of the suffering of a
	nation (Bachmann et al., 2021). Our interviews with young Polish adults have further dived into
	the topic, thus shedding light on the degree to which Poles perceive the Holocaust as a great time
	of suffering for their nation, and the alignment they choose to enact between their fate and that of
	the Jews. Through the analysis of the interviews using Atlas.ti, the main themes of 'victim
	mentality', 'narrative of innocence', and 'foreign occupation' have surfaced. <br/><br/>

	The nationwide surveys we have discussed in an antecedent section also reinforce the same
	narrative, seeing as a majority of Poles believe their compatriots' implication in the Holocaust as
	supporters of the Germans to be untrue, and a very small percentage of respondents is able to
	assume responsibility (Bokszanski, 2005). Further confirmation of this is the commonality of the
	words 'sacrifice', 'occupation', and 'bravery of the Poles' in the interviews taken. Thus, we infer
	that the purpose of the memory laws, namely of reshaping and promoting a state-approved
	version of history has been diffused through the educational and cultural institutions of the state,
	thus confirming the statement of Pettai (2020), that memory laws are a visualization of the
	character of the state, in a much larger percentage than they are connected to the historical events
	in question.<br/><br/>

	<h4>Limitations</h4>
	In terms of the full validity and reliability of this essay, we must discuss a short list of limitations
	that the reader must be aware of. First and foremost, this paper is not a literature review and thus
	presents a narrow view and interpretation of factors. If all the other narrative shaping elements
	possible were considered in the case of Poland, one might not be as able to be certain that that
	relationships between certain factors and attitudes are causal. Additionally, the interviews we
	have conducted have been of great aid in confirming the theories presented by other authors,
	however, a larger number and a high depth would have allowed this paper to analyze multiple
	layers. Nevertheless, the insights gained from the interviews give a general indication as to what
	the prevailing sentiments are among young Poles, and this paper proposes a feasible explanation
	of these sentiments, locating them in the effectful propagation of memory laws. Lastly, the
	authors were restricted to the use of English language sources. Even though it might have been
	very fruitful to also include and compare domestic Polish sources in Polish language, the lack of
	corresponding language knowledge prevented this. Future research might aim to compare foreign
	coverage of the enactment of the memory laws to polish sources to examine potential similarities
	and differences.
