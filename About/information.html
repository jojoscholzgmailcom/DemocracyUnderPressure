			<h4 style="text-align: center;">Democracy under Pressure</h4>
			Democracy, constitutional law and the rule of law are trending topics nowadays. 
			Hardly a day goes by on which these topics are not discussed in the news. 
			Populism is alternatively described as a threat to democracy and the rule of law on the one hand, 
			or the salvation of it on the other. Populists criticise the educated elites and argue that governments, 
			parliaments and particularly judges are corruptible and not responsive to the ‘common man’. 
			They portray themselves as the true defenders of democracy and the will of the majority. 
			However, they themselves are often criticised as a threat to pluralist democracies and the rule of law 
			(for instance the independence of judges). Examples of these debates can for instance be found in the U.S.,
			Poland, Hungary and India. <br/><br/>

			This broadening module is about democracy and constitutionalism as a form of collective self-government 
			in an increasingly populist world. It describes the most common constitutional concepts in Western democracies
			and introduces students to the way in which the self-governance of the people that democracy promises, 
			shapes constitutional law and electoral systems. It also offers a reflection on the role of populism in all 
			this and invites students to reflect upon current events using these analytical lenses.

			<h4 style="text-align: center;">The Role of Populism - Summer School</h4>
			Even though liberal democracy is often thought of as the best (or least bad) form of government, this
			system still requires a lot of choices to be made. In the connecting broadening module, students will
			have gained an understanding of what those choices are and how they shape the political life of a
			state, and the position of minorities in it. For instance, different electoral systems can have radically
			different outcomes, and most countries seem to think theirs is the fairest of them all. While these
			major constitutional choices that have to be made can be rationally analysed, in most states tradition
			or history plays as influential a role in making them as rational debate does. For this reason the
			narrative of the collective identity of a state is of great importance in understanding the functioning
			of its constitution, democracy and political system. <br/><br/>
			This summer school analyses the narrative of the collective identity of Poland and finds the links
			between its history and constitutional law themes that are of major importance in the Polish context,
			such as the pre-emanating importance of sovereignty. Core topics are the following:
			- the role of history, symbolism and identity in modern-day perceptions of what it means to be a
			‘people’;<br/><br/>
			- the role of political parties in shaping and representing the people;<br/>
			- the role of parliaments and governments in the self-governance of a people;<br/>
			- the role of populism in modern-day democratic debates;<br/>
			- the question of who ultimately gets to decide on who the people are what the consequences of this
			way of shaping the collective identity are."
